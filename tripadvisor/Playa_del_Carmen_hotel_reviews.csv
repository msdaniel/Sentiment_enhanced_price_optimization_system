Our 5th time back! It's been 5 years since we've been here.  Valentin gets better every time! The staff and service is impeccable! The staff is friendly and offers to help you, from the grounds keeper to the concierge.  The food in all the restaurants are delicious!  They will adapt the menu the best they can for diet allergies.      I have to mention names,  as these employees go above and beyond in service.     Dora ; guest experience coordinator.  She remembers every guest! Always taking time to talk to us and get to know us.  She is so helpful and professional.  I'm glad you are back my Dora! You have become a good friend.   Other employees that stand out,      Miguel; the waiter at Terra restaurant.  Noemi ,manager, and Daretza, hostess"

This resort exceeded all of my expectations. I wrote a blog post on my travel blog so if you're interested in reading a detailed review just message me for the link!  I normally stay at Excellence Riviera Cancun and this resort was slightly better in almost every category, so if you have specific questions regarding the comparison between resorts just message me. We never went hungry, we are not foodies by definition but we know good food and this resort has that. Drink service at the pools was fairly slow, but you're never further than 30 seconds away from the closest bars so it never became an issue.   We also had the Prive package, the best inclusions of this are 1. being able to reserve bali beds at the pool and 2. being able to"

The mini fridge is fully stocked with water, beer, juice, soda, diet soda, and chips. The shampoo and soap are made with local honey and smell divine.

If you're looking for nightlife every night they have some sort of entertainment for you to enjoy along with music and a DJ in the plaza. If you're looking for a fun environment to hang out the main pool is the place to be during the day. The GO Entertainment team was phenomenal. They try to get the crowd involved with everything they do. You have to do the ""magic carpet"" run...racing people on the floating mats across the pool.

I highly recommend you take advantage of the local mini-excursions they offer at the beach (not free), and go to the nightly shows they offer (free). Don't forget Don Miguel between meals and events!

We have been to most of the Karisma resorts over the last 12 years and are always impressed with the attention to detail and amazing food. We've been hearing about the Nickelodeon resort for years and was really looking forward to going since we now have young kids. Originally, we were going to stay at this resort for our visit this summer, but after reading the reviews here on Tripadvisor and doing a day visit, I feel like we dodged a bullet. If you are used to other resorts, including the El Dorado Royale, Generations, Azul, or Maroma, this resort majorly lacks the quality food, service, and care for its members and visitors.

The beach is not swimmable, I knew this going in, but I took a look at it myself and it was awful.

First, if you are visiting and are thinking of beautiful blue water and white sandy beaches. This is DEFF not it. The water is brown (as it is seaweed season) and even if it wasn't there is huge cement blocks in the water and nothing to sit on in the sand.  The waterpark is really nice, it offers slides for all ages.

The waterpark area is where we spent 3 of our 5 days and there was never a dull moment.  This is where we met the best Team Nick employees ever.  Michelle was over all the games and my daughter loved playing all the games.  Then there was Zues and Ferny who went above and beyond to interact with the children.  They made a lasting impression on my daughter and us as well.  I couldn't have asked for a better experience and we will be back!!

Buffets had the best option and while room service was convenient if you wanted to stay in, it does take ~45 minutes to arrive and somehow the food didn't compare as well to eating on-site at the restaurants. - Gym was well maintained.

All the employees we interacted with were all very friendly and attentive. We went to the character dinner which cost us over $700 for a family of 5. This was really pricey in our opinion and would not recommend it. The cast performance during dinner meet and greet was all"

It was family friendly, clean, and most importantly, filled with FUN! We truly had no complaints and enjoyed every moment - from Aqua Nick to meals to the children’s programming and activities to the family- centered night activities. It exceeded my expectations!  First, the facilities are incredibly clean; the staff is kind, helpful, and so nice; and there are a variety of restaurants to choose from. Our room was spotless, and the layout was perfect. The pool outside is clean, well kept, and so is the entire area around it and the swim-up bar.   The hotel and lobby aren’t connected - they’re about a 2 minute ride away across the property.

The people that work there are the best and the resort and food is nice.  However, we have a family of five, with three boys aged 12, 10, and 9 YO.  Unfortunately, the Kids Zone is only for kids 10 years and younger so since our oldest couldn’t go, we could not use it.  The water park is small and good for younger kids, but my older boys lost interest relatively quickly.  I thought it would be bigger than it is. There is absolutely not enough seating with shade at any of the pools, especially the water park.  It was stressful everyday trying to find a comfortable place to sit.  They use to have a game room pre-covid, but have not opened it back up, which I think would have been nice for older kids.  There are not many activities"

There is a kids pool, water part, and a kids club. There are also a lot of wild animals roaming the property, mostly coatis and spider monkeys. The staff makes no effort to chase animals away from hotel grounds.  The problem with wild animals and kids is that... Soon enough, your young kids will try to interact with these wild animals. That can end badly, and so it did. My 5-year old son was bit by a coati on hotel grounds. Luckily, nothing serious (but it could be, as they can carry diseases and parasites). A doctor saw us in our room, which cost us almost 250 USD (200 for visit, 38 for some antibacterial cream).

We never regret booking at Paradisus; quality and cleanliness are guaranteed. It’s our default choice for all-inclusive vacations. This last experience was different in a positive way; that positive gap was made with one person, our concierge, Jonathan Vergara. Jonathan was always one step ahead of your needs, willing to help you quickly and efficiently address any request. As a rule of thumb, we don’t go to the same place twice, but this experience at Playa del Carmen with Jonathan trigger us to rethink our rule.

Beautiful, spacious and comfortable rooms. Excellent service (Mexico at its best!) The food is ok but nothing to write home about. I have to mention we did not experiment the finest restaurant. Importantly and quite deceiving for a Mexican hotel, the margaritas were not good (probably quality of lime, too watery, and wrong proportions). Disappointed by the beach: because of the sargasos. This is a plague that affects almost all of the Riviera Maya. They had to install barriers at 200m from shore that effectively protect but ruin the beauty of the sea. In summary, go there to relax, enjoy the luxurious installations but don’t expect the dreamlike beaches that defined Riviera Maya 10 years ago."

If anyone's wondering whether it's worth it to go on the off season, the answer is absolutely yes - the resort was uncrowded and the rain came and went quickly.   All of the staff at Mayakoba was fantastic, but Sandra at the Sands kids club went above and beyond. She was incredibly kind, accommodating, and professional. I can't thank her enough, she took our trip from lovely to unforgettable. We can't wait to go back next year."

Before arrival, the staff kindly assisted with planning for a special event between me and my (now) fiancée - suggesting events, food, drink, everything.   When we arrived we were both blown away by the quality of the resort physically - rooms and public spaces, and golf carts and bicycle routes between locations. More than that though, the staff - concierge, wait staff, drivers, bellmen - are honestly some of the kindest people I’ve ever met. Even if another resort were to offer better rooms, amenities or deals, I would come back to Banyan Tree every time - and we plan to.   Food and drink are also of course out of this world. Ceviche, guacamole, and margaritas by the beach is a paradise in itself. Saffron is not bad"

In my opinion it certainly was not worth the money.  I’ve been to Grand Velas next door on several occasions and it is far superior.  The service and rooms were ok at best.  We were in a 3 bedroom unit that was not ocean front.  The golf cart situation was not enjoyable.

The jacuzzi water was not clear, and there was an oil sheen on the surface of the pool. We turned the jacuzzi jets on, and were subsequently unable to turn them off.

Extremely helpful in providing information about the resort and menu items. We look forward to seeing Oscar every year. Oasis was our favorite server while by the beach. He kept us laughing and having fun all day.  Diego and Eddie are some of our favorites too. They always provide us with personalized & attentive service. Overall the resort is beautiful but its the amazing people who work there"

The resort is a fabulous property that has awesome accommodations and countless food options.  Everyone there was willing to help and at no time we have any issues with staff or the team.   The only recommendation I have is to figure out how to cool the bathrooms in the 1 bedroom beach front casitas.  The air conditioner did not keep that area cool the entire time we were there.  Eventually we had an area fan brought in though by management and that was a good fix.    I would highly recommend this resort and we will hopefully go back soon."

Beach is well maintained and the seaweed barrier set up makes the beach the only swimmable one that we visited during our stay in Mexico.  Hotel is very clean and food is amazing.  The food is very expensive, however, so I do recommend doing the all-inclusive if you plan to stay more than a couple of nights.  The bikes they give you to ride around the property are a lot of fun and a neat amenity.  Property itself is secluded and very safe.  You can also eat at the Rosewood or Banyan Tree and charge to the room."

Grounds are clean and easy to navigate—we visited during low season and despite there being on-going construction projects, nothing ever felt intrusive or disruptive. The main pools are well kept and offer areas for small children and adults. The beach is wonderfully maintained with staff doing what seem like hourly seaweed sweeps.

There were so many great things about our stay yet some really lacking a 5-star property in this category that ruined it. First off, the service from the door men was above and beyond. Enrique was by far the most single helpful person during our stay, with excellent recommendations, guidance and knowledge. The rooms were serviced multiple times a day and well prepped. And the golf cart transportation was always prompt at Fairmont (Absolutely horrible when at Andaz, beware). Unfortunately, this is where the great service ended. Multiple times over multiple days we could not get the concierge or main number to answer when trying to coordinate dinner, golf, or general questions.  The dining was EXTREMELY underwhelming for"

We always stay on an all inclusive basis and this time we appreciated the expanded dining options with improved menus across restaurants and bars. The breakfast buffet at La Laguna was excellent as always. We enjoyed going to Brisas and Fuego for lunch as both restaurants had excellent sea food options. For dinner our favourite was Tauro restaurant that had one of the best food, service and selection of wines. In addition, we liked live music there on weekends. Hix"

There is a very intimate feel to the whole property which is all laid out along a gorgeous well maintained beach and connected inland with a winding brick road through the jungle that can be traversed by foot, by bikes that are readily available, or a tram that can be requested. For solos, I do recommend requesting the tram to go to and from the lovely Mar di Olivo restaurant as it is quite a hike to go on your own at night.

There are so many wonderful staff to thank and I want to start by acknowledging all the unsung heroes who work tirelessly behind the scenes, every day at dawn, there are numerous workers clearing the beach so we can step on a clean beach, there are people clearing the resort main road constantly so it is clean for us to walk on.

They are very sneaky and scam you for every little thing you do. I tried to call home to our bank about a wire transfer and they charged us $187. There was no warning on the phone about charges for long distance calls. Its not 1985 anymore, a call from Mexico to the U.S shouldnt cost $20, especially if the call doesnt go through. We were having our wedding reception and it had to be moved inside because of the rain. We didn't use some of the equipment we paid for, and they wouldn't refund it. Do not use the spa here, that is also a scam. The night of our wedding reception my wife had her makeup done at the spa. They literally made her look 50 years older. She had to wash it off right away. Luckily she had enough time to do her own makeup"

The grounds are breathtaking with all the animals, the waterfalls and the lush.  The beach is perfect.  Really amazing.  But there's always the problem of rude people saving chairs with a banana or a flip flop and not using the chairs all day.  The hotel staff should pick up the stuff on the chairs that are NOT reserved with a hotel towel.  That way, there would be enough chairs on the beach for everyone.  But there isn't enough because of that.  Same problem for the pool.  The rooms are nice.  Not a lot of place to put away our stuff but it was not a huge problem for us.

Shout out to Alejandro and Alfredo for making our check-in so easy and enjoyable. A great way to be welcomed!   I really only have one negative thing to say, the food was not great, I expected a little better.  All of the staff was very pleasant and did everything they could to accommodate us. Whether a change of room at check in, or finding us a table at an a la Carte when we didn’t have a reservation.  I was extremely grateful that they have the “ no saving chairs” policy at the pool and beach. If it was busy and chairs were left unattended for hours, the towels were removed with a note left behind explaining why. I have been to resorts that have had the same policy but"

Overall the resort was very lovely and as usual, the staff were amazing.   You do have to make reservations as their restaurants and I recommend doing that the first or second day to get what you want. We tried: Italian (great food and wonderful service); Mexican and Japanese (by far the best meal I had there and also a wonderful time). I found the main buffet to offer lots of options and had no issues with the food there other than sometimes it wasn't as hot as I would like but this comes with buffet territory.

If my only interaction was with the restaurant and bar employees it likely would have been a 5-star stay.  These employees are very pleasant and genuinely care for the guests.  The same cannot be said for the employees at the Desk and resort management.  A credit card charge of $600 was charged at check-in which is a hold for incidentals, tipping, etc. during your stay.  This amount is supposed to be returned at check-out (less what you actually incur in charges).  At check-out we were charged approximately $400 for our actual tipping and other charges.  I agree with these charges.  The $600 charge however has never been returned.  For two months I've been getting a song and dance from resort management that ""the charges have"

I love this place but it's a very important day for me and there is no assistance. I send emails repeatedly with no response. They should be reaching out TO ME. I'm getting really nervous.

In order, we have stayed in beach cabana 3, 158, 157, 131 and currently find ourselves back in 131.  Overall the resort is still one of the best in Playa but has slipped somewhat in terms of condition and level of service during this visit when compared to our other stays.  Somewhat of a guess but this regression could be due to the recent change in ownership which I was told  occurred a few months ago.  In speaking to several of the staff, there is a feeling of apprehension for the future as they expect some change in how the resort is run under the new owners.  One example of the “rumored” changes is the potential installation of a beach club similar to what you find up"

The staff and the service are awesome. In particular Elizabeth and Rolegio. Rogelio made our visit very memorable, he made sure we were always satisfied and went above and beyond to make us feel happy.   Our family is vegetarian, and the staff at Fuego went out of their way to accommodate us, because of them we had so many options to choose from when eating.  The location is perfect, there is direct access to the beach, and both restaurants, Las Olas and Fuego have a beautiful view of the ocean. The resort is also within close proximity to 5th Avenue, great for taking a stroll in the famous tourist area."

The resort/beach was beautiful. We stayed in the caribe’s located right on the beach with a private plung pool, which was so worth it. The beach is public and has a good bit of foot traffic, but the locals were respectful + you have a private section roped off with chairs just for you. The staff was amazing-they were all polite, attentive, and always making sure we were taking care of (we are a younger couple so having people to look out for us was extremely nice). Major shout out to Mota and Mariano for making this the most memorable trip.  10/10 recommend staying here for any occasion."

With high expectations we were surprisingly disappointed by the lack of some fundamental amenities and services. We believe this could be due to the hotel changing ownership hands recently. Here is a summary of our experience below:   Positives:  - Fantastic location with easy access to the main strip, full of vibrancy, bars and restaurants, as well as having the beach within foot steps. - Beautiful grounds which were clean and well maintained. - Breakfast staff in Las Olas were fantastic- they provided a 5* plus service and went over and beyond to meet any requests.

Elezier was also great at booking our trips.   However, this hotel is extremely noisy due to the public beach. There is hotel music until 5 am at least and the bubble tea shop next door blasts music from 7am. It was hard to sleep most nights which made the trip less enjoyable."

Alex walked me back to the changing area and waited for me to prepare for the ritual which he said is to cleanse the old energy and welcome in the new. You are then escorted to a hot tub where salts are added and you relax before being taken to a waiting room with iced green tea and more cold aromatherapy towels.

I’ll start off by listing the only two pros of this hotel which are the nice spacious hotel rooms and the location (centrally situated and 2 min away from the main strip, 5th Ave).  Now, for the cons… simply put, the hotel CUSTOMER SERVICE was TERRIBLE.  We stayed at the Reef 28 for 7 days and aside from the Excursions representative (Nancy) and one server (Paola), everyone else was short/rude/dismissive/inattentive.  The rooftop pool area (more of a very small-sized lap pool) was the worst.  We visited the rooftop pool on 3 separate occasions and each time we found ourselves uncomfortably"

On day one, there was a person who called themselves the ""concierge."" he was very friendly and helpful on things to do on Playa del carmen, but that's how he traps you. He is actually trying to get you to go to a ""presentation"" for 90 minutes, but all it is, is another trick. He says it's not a time share, but it really is.
