Now on to the negatives, the hotel is in poor condition.  The buildings are outdated and the beds dont have headboards (see pic).  The food is subpar and always cold.  The drinks are the lowest premium and they reuse the plastic cups.   Birds are everywhere and they eat off of the food that the staff leaves sitting around.  Old food and bird poop everywhere you eat ( see pics ).   The staff for some reason always wanted to see our wristbands but never asked anyone else.   We are in trying times, money and vacation are a blessing so dont go here !!!   This resort caters to locals and Spanish-speaking customers."

In the bar, Marcos makes sure we always have cool drinks and even makes me a special cocktail for Mother's day!  The Mexican night on Tuesdays is must!  We will definitely go back!"

Once I arrived, I was hesitant to stay there based on the reviews, but decided to go check it out since I had already booked it.  The place looked run down from the outside.  I walked around the area, and did not see many people enjoying the pool and no one was a the small area of the beach that belong to the hotel.  It looked empty . I asked to see the rooms and was told that I could not see them until I checked in - not a good sign.  I am sure that if the outside was run down, the inside was in similar shape.  They took my money since they have a no refund policy."

The people at the front desk can be short and rude. The food was not the best but the drinks were great.  The first room that we were given was dark and had a weird smell, the hot water did not work. We requested to have our room changed and the second room was okay but definitely not a great room.   We will definitely stay at a different hotel next time we travel to Cancun."

I say that lightly, because if you do not want to be bothered and want full relaxtion, it most definetely is the place. So, the check in. We had travelled for 15 hours, been awake for nearly 30 and arrived at 8.30am. I let the hotel know in advance that we would be arriving at this time, however we were still unable to check in until 3pm. Which was very annoying. We had to wait to get to a room to sleep in and so made use of the bar.. which was closed until 11am, so we went down to the beach (which has bars, but is not part of this review). At 11am on the dot, we went to the bar near the Cielo restaurant, got a tequila sunrise and a beer and waited around"

Mr. Marco has the best music (reggae, ska, rock), attention, jokes and good vibe. If you visit Dos Playas, your first visit it must be to the bar with Mr. Marco for a Piña Colada. ✨"

Very dirty hotel, after complain to Love holidays they send as to another room which was smaller and felt like panishment. Staff speak very little English, in hotel mostly Spanish speaking people. We felt like isolated and discriminated! Food wise  names in Spanish unable to understand having food allergy struggle every day. Food was good. Plates always dirty. The burgers looked terble and taste similar.  No choice in drink bar at all just beer and tequila and vodka plus rum.  Plus some blue and red additives.  Entertainment in Spanish language unable to participate.  Do not listen to staff.... Buy little gifts from the people walking on the beach, much cheeper.  Prices for gifts in town horrendous, like little"

PLEASE DO NOT BOOK!!! TRUST THIS REVIEW!!!  I booked two weeks with all inclusive at this resort.  The food is really disgusting!!!!  You can not eat it. I expect at least decent food as I booked this vacation to relax and not worry about eating.   This is one of my worst bookings ever.  I have email formal complain directly to the hotel but I did not get any reply.  I will take this matter further and post on social media everywhere. This hotel resort is to be avoided. Nothing is as advertised.   The positive reviews which says otherwise are not true. Believe me I do not complain and I never leave review. However, travelling form far and being hungry for two weeks it is not a joke. I would not give any stars to this review."

I would recommend making a reservation and having dinner there, the food was amazing (the best food in this hotel), and Israel gave us the best service ever.  - I also want to make a shout-out to the entertainment team, they did a great job during my stay with live music almost every night. People were dancing, and singing along which made me really love it. Cons: - Room is kinda outdated: you can hear people talking from the outside all the time, the faucet was leaking, the toilet wasn't flushing, etc.  - The food from the buffet was not good at all, but I asked some people and they said it was good, so I guess this is just my personal opinion. I prefer having dinner at Cielito"

We are visiting from Canada.  Cleanliness:  This place gets a 1.5 for cleanliness and maintenance, all around. From the buffet/restaurants to the rooms and grounds, it's majorly lacking. There is always trash EVERYWHERE and no one seems to care the fix the problem. It would be nice if the other guests had an ounce of care, but clearly they don't either. Walls are dirty. Floors/ground is dirty. Windows are dirty.  Pools:  The ""activities pool"" is supposed to be adult only and have all kinds of stuff going on, but the entertainment staff don't really start the activities... and since we don't speak spanish, the few announcements they did make"

This place is uncared for and dumpy.  Room service dishes with half eaten food remained on hallway table after attendant showed me the room and stayed there overnight.  Moved them one floor down onto stair landing where they remained at noon the next day when I checked out.  “Not my job” mentality of staff.  Guests ignore no smoking signs and smoke wafts throughout property as a result.  Door too roof rusted out and unsecured.   My room (304) had been updated and seemed nice but was neglected and finished in slipshod manner, wallpaper job on headboard wall was a joke with wavy edge lines and pencil cutting marks visible.  There were strange smears on newly installed surfaces and construction dust on edges that were not checked after construction “cleanup.”"

I did not do all-included because I went all over the place and I ate outside on the restaurants and street.   From this hotel, you can go to the rest of hotels, zona Hotelera or downtown cancun, mercados 28  (Tourist) and 23 (local and cheaper) by taxi, UBER, (send me a question about this) or cheapest, local bus which is 24 hours.

We ate at the restaurant directly looking onto the beach. The staff were very friendly, the barman on the beach and Jacky at breakfast were fantastic. It was nice to be in a more authentic hotel and not one of these massive impersonal chains. There are plenty of pools, although slightly lacking in sunbeds, they look over the sea and a really comfy. It looks like they have refurbished some of the rooms and are doing it step by step. Although the bathroom could do with replacing, the beds were good quality. All in all a great holiday, great value for money."

What a great hotel to chill and unwind. The staff were all really helpful especially Joilo and Luis Con from the restaurant who were so helpful, kind and friendly. They were there literally everyday with their great smiles and our drinks were there before we even asked. The food was great snd felt spoilt for choice in the restaurant as well as pizza, sushi, burgers and hot dogs. The Mexican food was the best though. The room was clean and tidy with lovely fresh towels and a great hot shower. The beach was perfect with plenty of sun beds. There were 5 pools and lots of areas on the beach and around the pools to rest and relaxed. It would be great for all ages and very family friendly. Great location near the ferry"

Everyday activities, like yoga, zumba, volleyball in a swimming pool. Alive show with real Mexican singers, dancers, actors. Just to choose! The location is perfect, close to everything (bus stop, ferry, pharmacy, money exchange, convenience store). The hotel has its own lovely beach and a tour agent.

I feel like most negative reviews are from ppl that expect next door service of Riu for the budget costs. After the first day you realize the charm here and love it more and more. Could some things be improved? Sure. But that will also come at extra cost. For now you get great food, decent drinks, lovely beaches and not overly crowded hotel.  My suggestion to the hotel would be to have a coffee station available all day long and not just for meals."

The hotel is old, run down. The room we got was small, with a fungus in the bathroom and a terrible smell. It was certainly not a room where we could comfortably spend 2 weeks on our honeymoon, there was not even a place to take clothes out of the suitcases. My rating is influenced only by the rating of the service! The owners should appreciate what employees they have! I have never experienced such nice, polite and helpful service! Our favorites from the second shift Guadalupe and Fidel,  from the morning Armando, Jairo ( Lewandowski :) ), Louis and many other people whose names I don't remember they took care of us every single day! Of course, I couldn't forget about the guys from the bar - Jose Rios, Alfredo,"

Much appreciated the food from Ismael, Juan , Haroldo, Miguel, Jesus and Maricela. From the pizzeria, Sushi, Thai and marquesinas.

The condition of hygiene and terrible health.  The food disgusting and everything dirty.  The worst thing was the second night we couldn't sleep because of so much noise from all sides and they were hammering in another nearby room.  We decided with my husband to change hotels and when requesting a refund of the unused days they took advantage of discounting one more night.

Good Points:  First this has to be Lupito the waiter at the restaurant. He was brilliant. Smiley, happy, polite and went the extra mile to make us feel like we were on our holidays. The other waiting on staff were also very friendly. Then the barman by the beach. The funny Cocktail maker (didn't get his name) he was very funny and made us with fantastic cocktails and provided entertainment whilst making the drinks. ""Maximum Power"" was his catchphrase.
