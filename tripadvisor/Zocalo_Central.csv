It was a chilly 8c. We arrived at our hotel at 730 am and rested for a couple of hours before heading out on a walking tour of the historic area. By this time it was warming up and now bright and sunny. We found the historic area full of beautiful buildings and as the Sunday morning developed the city became a bustling hive of activity."

He loved it! This is my second time staying in this hotel and it will be our official headquarters when we visit the city. What can I say? We had a wonderful experience, the hotel is beautiful, you can see the impeccable care and attention in everything, delicious food, with breathtaking views to catedral and el zocalo and in a prime location. In addition to this, I would like to add the wonderful customer service and care from the hotel personnel. The people who work there are the most warm, attentive and welcoming! I felt back at home!.

The breakfast is abundant and is included. You can have the buffet or specially made meals which are extraordinary. The 24-hour cafe in which you can get beers and sandwiches and soups and other things is both aesthetically beautiful and unbelievably a reliable. If you're getting up at 5:00 in the morning for a tour you can grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee before you hit the road.

We wanted a central location to explore the city, since we were visiting the first time. Zocalo Central was perfect for us -- literally steps away from the Zocalo and most of the major sights we wanted to see. The Christmas festival was held on the Zocalo at this time, and it was very exciting to be a part of the energy of the city. The hotel is very close to the Zocalo metro. Walking in the doors of the hotel always felt like stepping into an oasis of calm away from the busy streets of the city, so it was a perfect combination of being able to experience the city and to retreat to a quiet space. Breakfasts on the balcony were a real highlight of the trip. The music, the friendly staff and attentive service -- it"

It is centrally located in the historical center, nicely updated, great staff, love the free cafeteria. The rooms are a bit small but I think you can upgrade to more spacious rooms. It has a restaurant at the rooftop but I would recommend that you eat elsewhere. The breakfast is good but the dinner is not worth the price. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice hotel in centro histórico."

The tour company they use, Estur Mexico, provided excellent tours with amazing tour guides. This was our first time stay in Mexico City and it was an awesome experience! I think that choosing to stay at Zocalo Central was one of the main reasons that we had such a great visit. Way to go Zocalo and staff!"

The cozy lobby leads to the 24 hour free coffee/sandwich/beer shop. Yes, I said free. We had the basic room, and although it is on the small size, it did not lack for comfort in any way! Each side of the very large bed had an end table. The air conditioning worked real well and so did the tv.  The included breakfast was wonderful with great service and delicious food.  The location is also excellent, just a short block from Zocalo.  This hotel serves a lot of bang for your buck! We loved it."

Who does that?  And also a smaller fridge at each floor that gives you free bottles of water (and apples) too. - The rooftop hotel has a very nice view for breakfast and drinks at night.

It is absolutely gorgeous and we got way more than we paid for or expected.  We reserved a jr. suite with double bed and balcony overlooking the historic Zocalo about 6 months prior.  This was our first trip to Mexico City.  I've always wanted to visit the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe and this year, my dream came true.  All I can say is WOW!  I was blown away by the city, the history, and so many tours and things to do.  We hired a private guide and that was an excellent idea because she took us to so many places and gave us the history and info of everything without having any sort of time limits or other restrictions.  After a full day of exploring, we came back and had a sandwich/salad as a light dinner, which the"

It is quite busy, not just in their little elevators, but also outside, where Centro is...intense!  The saving grace is the staff here (especially Raul and the front desk).  Their pledge to provide free beers and snacks to guests, 24 hours a day, is baffling but fun once you get used to it.  We loved eating the amazing free breakfast at Balcon de Zolcolo, and we went there for several meals as well.  It's worth going to Balcon de Zolcolo in the evening to see the light when it hits the cathedral, as well as early in the morning (as early as you can stand it) to get a good table for their breakfast.  We do wish they had mini-fridges in their rooms, and a set of stairs that's easy to use.  But, highly recommend this place."

For example: They arranged terrific drivers for our group of 3 women. One dropped us off at a club and picked us up precisely when we scheduled his return. The other dropped me off at the airport and chased after me with the cell phone I’d left in the backseat!!! Thank you Zocolo Central!!!"

Daniel accompanied my husband and went around to over 10 local hotels in order to find us a room. We returned to the Zocalo the next day for 2 nights. We called Daniel & Raul our angels as they truly saved us. Concierge also helped us with directions and so much more. All staff were always more than happy to assist us.

A big plus was the cafe that offered almost everything you could want in terms of a quick snack including the free breakfast every morning, who does all that?

From the moment we arrived until the moment we left we were treated like the most important members of the Zocalo family.  Rosalia had a free concert, therefore the streets were blocked and we couldn’t make it to our hotel.  The bell men literally ran to our car to get us a block away, we didn’t call, they were just watching!  The cafe with free sandwiches, soups, salads, drinks, and beer are amazing-24/7.  The Balcony Resturant-magical.  Outstanding free breakfast & scrumptious dinners.  The concierge handles every area of our travel-don’t forget the free walking tour, starting in the lobby.  Our rooms were so comfortable, clean, and fully equipped with a safety deposit book. Time to leave, the bellmen and concierge made sure we were"

The hotel was excellent and beautiful. All the staff were at your every needs specially Edith and Raul. We have such a great experience that this is the hotel for us always. They had a launch that was 24/7 fool of drinks alcoholic and none, sandwiches, soups and other item at your request. They help you in advance to get checked in to the airlines, taxis, and much more. And it was so secure that you could only use the elevator with your key. The complimentary breakfast was awesome at the the top of the restaurant. And the view from there was amazing. The restaurant was more fancy than some of our expensive 5 star restaurants here in the USA. I recommend highly this hotel you will not be disappointed."

The hotel is modern and well-situated in the historic centre of Mexico City, directly across from the Catedral Metropolitana del la Ciudad de Mexico and the Plaza de la Constitucion or Zocalo. This is a good point to explore downtown Mexico City.  The Hotel offered a complimentary guided walking tour of the downtown area provided by Mexico a pié tour company. We took this tour on our first day, and Arturo, the guide and wrestler, provided useful contemporary and historical information about Mexico City. Well worth requesting when you book.  Our suite featured high ceilings and patterned carpets that reflect the use of muted Mexican tiles in public spaces. This creates a cool and calm environment"

All the restaurants and shopping were walkable distances. The free fare at the coffee shop is certainly an added bonus. The food at the terrace restaurant was excellent and you could not ask for a better view as it overlooked the metropolitan cathedral and central square. A suggestion is that the shower heads should be changed to make it adjustable since the pressure was so much that it felt like needles when taking a shower. Overall will highly recommend this hotel if you visit Mexico City."

Rooftop breakfast is very good. Safe clean place, spacious rooms. Air con is not the best. Very blowy and cold, not a “calm” air con unfortunately, but at least they have openable windows. Also would be nice if they had a couple of English channels on the tv, for those of us who don’t want to go out at night. But all in all, a very good hotel"

Great breakfast and excellent benefit of free cafe! Rooms businesslike and ok in size. Staff perhaps need a better can do attitude.

The rooms are spacious, nicely decorated, and well appointed. This time we stayed on the first floor, due to construction on the 5th floor. We recommend staying on the second floor or above to avoid people seeing into the room from the street. The bar serving drinks and snacks is a real plus! The breakfast is excellent and with a fabulous view of the zocalo. The staff are very helpful and arranged for a cab to the airport when the driver we had scheduled on our own didn’t show up at the appointed time."

The staff was so accommodating and friendly, as well as spoke English when my phrasebook fell short (yes google translate is good but I wanted to try myself lol) and  I always got seated in the “front row” table at the amazingly delicious buffet &/or order (all complimentary!)  breakfast to see all the view:  so appreciated that! I am a prolific picture taker so it was a thrill!!  My room was spectacular & clean: huge bathroom!!!

I chose the Zocalo Central based off of the reviews I read on here and I can vouch for the accuracy of every glowing review: this place is amazing!  The location couldn't be more perfect. Out of the front door on Ave. 5 de Mayo, you're just a few feet (or meters) from the historic Zocalo and Cathedral. You're also just a ten minute walk from Alameda Park, which is an amazing people watching spot.  The Cafe is open 24hrs and food and drink were included in our rate; as well as a buffet breakfast each morning on the Balcon with breathtaking views over the Zocalo. It really doesn't get any better. And the food is wonderful. Treat yourselves at least once to a dinner at the Balcon del Zocalo"

The room was comfortable and clean. I loved the snacks that the cafeteria provides you trough out the day, the lady and the guys there were very attentive. The restaurant view is very nice, the food is savory, servers were very attentive. I want to give special recognition to Josmar Cosio, the transportation driver. Since He picked us up from the airport, He was very attentive,  respectful and communicative. Josmar gave us a brief of the important things around the city, gave us recommendations what to do and what not, thank you Josmar, you were fundamental in the success of our travel, hope to see you next time!"
