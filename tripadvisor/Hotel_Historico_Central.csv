The service is top notch, the staff are the best around.  I'm so glad to have stayed here this past weekend. Checked in on Wednesday and got dropped off in the pouring rain.  Staff was out there with an umbrella to help us in and get our luggage from the uber. Atenea, our concierge greeted us at the desk with a welcome cocktail and amazing service.  She made small talk and asked why we were in visiting.  We said we're from San Diego and here to see the city as well as perform with the Coro Gay Ciudad de Mexico that weekend (important to know). I checked into my room which had a little balcony that opened to the front of the hotel.  A handwritten card was on the bed with some candy and from Ingrid the general manager. The"

The room (with a small balcony) was perfect: clean, bath robes, stocked (free) beverages in the fridge. The complimentary breakfast menu was exceptionally nice. The staff were kind, caring, attentive. The food/coffee bar at the entrance of the hotel (open 2/24 and mostly complimentary) was really nice. All the staff (front desk, food servers, concierge, etc) was wonderfully present; Carlos, Jazmin, Dedier, are some of the names that come to mind. The woman who cleaned my room was also really wonderful (I wish I could remember her name). I've travelled a lot and I can confidently say that Historico Central has been the best hotel experience I've ever had."

The quality of the staff is superior, with cordial communication and efficiency a hallmark of the truly excellent service. We so appreciated the 24 hour cafe at Hotel Historico Central - the provision of sandwiches and drinks on request at no extra cost was exceedingly appreciated.

Monse and Adison took very good care of us in the Cafe even with food allergies (I hope I got the names right).

Loved the options at the Cafe (sometimes we choose eating at the Cafe over eating out!l) rooms were big and comfortable and wifi was good enough to take video calls.

We love the free breakfast and the waiters Luis, Roberto, Gonzalo and Arturo rendered 5 star service consistently.  The Central Coffee Shop with free sandwiches was also a big plus. The head Concierge, Rebecca, was so helpful and really professional. The free walking tour was not too tiresome for seniors like us. All in all we just love Historico Central!"

Breakfast was included with the room and was excellent.  The 24-hour cafe was a nice option, with a complimentary menu of food and soft drinks, beer and wine also are  available for a charge.

The location is great, being in the center of town with endless activities around the area, including tours. Speaking of, the hotel offers a free 3-4 hour tour during your stay, which touches all the main points in the immediate downtown/Zocalo area. It was great to hear the history and current standing of the city from very knowledgeable and entertaining guides. They are offered in both English and Spanish for any language barriers you may feel you’ll encounter."

I felt comfortable at all times, and the room was clean and had everything we needed.  The staff is next-level. They treated us like royalty, even spent time getting to know us and about our performances. One of the staff even went to our show to support us. After a long concert day, we came home to handwritten notes and gifts of congratulations. I have never been treated so well by any hotel, ever.
