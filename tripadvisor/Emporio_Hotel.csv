The staff was kind and attentive and tried their best to accommodate my requests. The breakfast and lunch were just fantastic! The room and bathroom were very clean and spacious, the only minus is that my towels were changed even when I've hanged them as I wanted to be eco-friendly..."

The hotel is charming. The rooms were impeccably clean and the staff was extremely attentive.  My room was modern, cozy and meticulous with a TV, jacuzzi, and comfortable bed.  The breakfast buffet was to die for.  Everything was fresh and including traditional Mexican dishes, lovely fruit, wonderful breads and pastries, and a grill where you can order eggs to your liking, French toast and pancakes.  The servers couldn’t have been more helpful.  Excellent, convenient neighborhood. Photos below of my wonderful breakfasts."

I am a very critical person when I travel and try to choose only the best hotels to say. Hotel Emporio was not an exception. The cleanliness of the hotel was impecable. I arrived early morning from a red eye flight; and even though I showed up to the hotel at 7am knowing it would be too early to check in I tried anyways. As expected my room was not yet ready. I went to the restaurant upstairs and had their breakfast buffet. When I was finally done (taking my time) I headed back to the lobby to wait. I want to give a HUGE shoutout to Don Ramon, who saw me struggling to stay awake and went to go check for a room. He"

The hotel is nice and the room was extremely clean, I want to give Major credit to our Maid Rebecca. I have never seen anybody care enough about their job to wrap the iron cord up so perfectly, very impressed. Every morning I would get coffee from the café downstairs, if it wasn’t for Fernando‘s help over the last few days I probably wouldn’t have been able to order anything as I don’t speak very good Spanish. So thank you Fernando! The only thing I don’t understand is why I couldn’t get my normal espresso on Sunday as the café was closed 😢 Fernando did accommodate me and got me some coffee from the upstairs restaurant but it’s no espresso I would say at least have one person working to be able to make good coffee.

Restaurant is great, we went to breakfast and also the brunch buffet and both were great, highly recommended! Rooms are tiny, beds are super small. On their website they advertise “extra large bed” and you come and find a twin bed. The AC did not work and the lighting in the room generates a lot of heat. The wifi is beyond horrible, if you are planning on getting work done or maybe streaming a movie you might want to forget about it. I got a pretty decent rate on their website however the sleep quality we had was not worth the price, I would not come back to this property."

They were friendly, helpful, and attentive. The housekeeping staff was especially accommodating, assisting me with an unusual request to swap my feather pillows for synthetic due to an allergy.

It is still in really good condition, particularly in the lobby which with a well dressed staff presents the image of a five star hotel, but the rooms are a different story. They very small and have comfortable beds but the  wood work is coming apart and the rooms are in need of repair or renovation. Also, I witnessed a staff member ordering a guest to follow its rules. Apparently, some of the hotel staff members are unaware (or don't care) that the only reason they have a job, and the only reason hotel remains in business - is because of its paying customers.  This kind of upside down thinking and behavior in businesses seems to be increasing. I guess"

The staff put too much passion on covid restrictions and forgot that their main business is hospitality. They took about 40 mins to bring the drinks. The process to check in is long.

I purchased a package though Volaris Airlines and had an issue upon check-in.  We were up-charged at reception for the double room (which I initially reserved and paid for through Volaris).  My single room was VERY small.  The bed was comfortable; the bathroom was fine, and the tv and channel selection was very good as well.  The room was clean and housekeeping did a good job.  The cafe on the 1st floor was very good and the staff was friendly (we didn't use the 2nd floor restaurant).  The gym was average and consisted of a treadmill, elliptical, and multi-weight set.  The A/C in the double room did not work to cool the room.  Technicians were not able to improve/repair the A/C. We had to request an additional fan to circulate the air."

My main complaints would be the flat pillows and paper thin walls (you can easily hear your neighbors coming and going, as well as people talking in the halls).  But overall the hotel is an excellent deal for the price.  Staff is also very nice; they promptly switched me to another room after I reported an issue with the original room.  Affordable all-you-can-eat buffet available downstairs as well with great food.  Would definitely consider staying again!"

Reforma  avenue ,where this hotel is located, seems to be a choice for some Mexican citizens to riot and practice urban terrorism. I personally had to request a card key to my room every other day, they stop working for no reason, it is really frustrating to go back to the front desk over and over."

Sure, the lobby looks nice and swanky, the facade is gorgeous, and the location is excellent, but.  But check-in took AN HOUR with only one person in line in front of me and three people behind the counter; check-out took 20 minutes too. Arriving from a 500km trip to stand in a lobby full of people not wearing face masks for an hour completely ruins the first impression.  But the geometry of the interior means the ceilings are very low and contribute to the impression of being cramped that you get once you're in your room. We got standard rooms and these were some of the smallest I've ever been in. The use of swing-out instead of sliding doors for all the closets, cubbies and"

This is the place to go. Although the room we used was small, it was practical and the decoration and lighting extraordinaire. The wedding party Saturday night did not keep us awake, although it could be heard. The service by Mr. Ramón Cobos is commendable. He went out of his way to move out bags in and out of storage as many times as it was needed. Breakfast in the premises are not recommended. Fortunately, there are many great places to eat within a 15 minute walk. We arrived past midnight, the door was opened promptly, before we dispatched the Uber service, and the registration was a breeze. So was check out.   Highly recommended, we will be back."
