We want to come back soon. Also we did a trip around Yucatán and we went to chichen itza. The hotel was good, good food, but the most Incredible one was the entertainment the hotel has by the pool, Ricky was the best host ever. The beach was clear and the resort wasn’t too busy that is something that we like. Definitly the entertainment team with Ricky is the best!!!!!!!!"

First night we arrived, no hot water after a 14h flight. The reception simply asked us to wait without giving us any other solution. This happened twice during our stay. No A/C in the room for a night, impossible to sleep. Once again no solution provided and we were simply being asked to wait.   For the restaurants, half of them are closed during the evenings and with very restricted options, the food is not tasty at all, same food everyday. So basically we were paying for restaurants which were closed. Again no compensation offered. Also when we ordered at the Bordeaux restaurant the food in our plate was not matching the menu, when we asked our server why, he just replied that they run out of it.

The vacation club presentation is not worth the resort money they give you to sit through thee presentation. I understand it's a 90 minute sales pitch that I got resort cash for sitting through but the sales folks are relentless. I sat through 4 different sales folks pitching me different options and was there far longer than 90 minutes.

Big square pool which can only be entered or exited by very cumbersome ladders.   Very difficult for many travelers! The pool is not in good shape.  The pool furniture has been worn out for years.   The restaurants are very subpar with limited choices.  Generally the food is undesirable.  The only saving grace is the wonderful staff. They have much work to do in their restaurants!  In 7 days we never experienced an enjoyable meal.   The beach is covered by seaweed and entering the water you must wade through the dense seaweed floating in the water."

We didn’t understand why they would just tell us that our room wasn’t ready or to have a seat until they could help us.
