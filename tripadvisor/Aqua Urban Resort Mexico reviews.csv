Everyone is so welcoming. Food is superb! Cesar (the afternoon Chef) will make sure all your meals are on point. Jesus, stoped by the table several times to make sure everything was perfect. Rafa, Jose Luis, the entire staff will make sure ANYTHING YOU NEED is met, and the cherry on top is Celestino, the Concierge. He is family now! Always with a smile, a good advice and a kind heart.  I will never change my stay in Mexico City: Live Aqua is my home away form home!"

The hotel restaurant provides a great breakfast with options for the ones who are not used to Mexican food. The same can be said for the lunch/dinner menu, which could use some more options. Important tip, apettizers can be as big as a main dish, so the tuna ceviche can easily fill one’s hunger without another plate. Deserts overall are nothing special, the Churros are great.

Yet management tries to gaslight you telling you the noise comes from the bar across the street.  I got changed from the 4th to the 5th floor but hardly makes a difference.  The room rumbles until 3 or 4am when the ballrooms finally close. Very disappointing and just no remorse from hotel management. Avoid Live Aqua like the plague.

The rooms were very spacious and cleaned twice a day! Refreshments at every floor was a pleasant surprise!The restaurant at the lower floor had excellent service and food. The attached mall gave us options for 5 star dining and even a play area. The only downside is the distance from downtown that always takes 45 mins to reach any time of the day. Overall a fabulous way to experience Mexico City!!!
