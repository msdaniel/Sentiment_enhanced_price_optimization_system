Because the property isn't big, you truly get to know the staff and it makes the experience much better. There's personalized service throughout, staff is really friendly, and there's nice activities on and off property. Highly recommend!"

We were invited to the hotel by the Legendary Vacation Club company. Please take my advice into consideration and do not get scammed. It was a huge waist of our time, at the end they offered us a day pass as a “gift certificate” which I am being charged for now. They also offered 2 all inclusive tour experience as an incentive to go hear their offers which at the end we would have to pay expensive transportation if we accepted so we just ended up wasting a full day of our vacation time :( The resort was deficient in many ways. If you want to experience this beautiful part of Mexico look for a better option worthy of your money."

We truly loved it both times though there were some notable changes, as to be expected after 5 years. The food was very good- the romantic dinner by the beach was gorgeous. We spent majority of our time at the pool and had the best service from Principe- he was AMAZING and made you feel like you were the most important person in the pool even though he was serving well over 20 people at a time. We did miss the taco bar that used to be by the pool but the burgers and pizza held us over until dinner. Maintenance was being done at the time but honestly we didn’t notice the noise much as we were just focused on enjoying ourselves. Our ONLY major complaint is the pushy sales to become Legendary members which"

Check in and check out are not efficient processes and take quite a bit of time to complete. Also the upselling of the resort both at check-in and check out, I do not enjoy.  The hotel itself is older, but if you can get past the aesthetic, it's a wonderful place to stay. The staff there is super accommodating, super friendly and are a great time to interact with. The food is quite good with my favorite restaurant being Toro with a very close second being zenn.  Every night the wait stuff of all the establishments were accommodating and quick with refills or any accommodation.  The hotel room itself is dated but they are doing renovations.

Hard Rock bases their guests attendance ON MEMBERSHIPS, hence you’ll see wristbands of different colors everywhere, this is for the staff to identify who deserves a better service despite how much people has paid for their vacation, and all this is a problem that corporation is very well aware of, I’ll explain soon.

Firstly staff,location,food and beach all superb.   Entertainment decent but bar options very poor ( there is no options only one lobby bar )    Trying to be fair I would imagine if you come for a short trip this would be sufficient but for 14 days it becomes monotonous especially as the entertainment staff never use 10 words where 100 will do and shout even though they have the use of a microohone.  Our biggest issue is the members tiers that Tui fail to warn you about and the reserving of every pool side bed for such members.   Don't get me wrong there's always beds available but it would be nice to get a front row bed near the pool bar but they all have owners nameplates on them from about 7am and towel station"

The kindness and going the extra mile by all the staff at this hotel is incredible. Our favorite restaurant was Frida and most favorite waiters at this one particular location were Iván and Carlos. Not only they they were happy to serve us but went beyond in giving us suggestions and advice on all sorts of information regarding food and drinks. Our room was located on the 10th floor and the views were spectacular as well as very clean and comfortable. We definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling with families and friends who are looking to be in one of the best spots in the hotel area in Cancun."

Concierge services are really professional, Fernando and Karen are doing an extremely well job, very professional, always with a great smile and attitude, always willing to help and very knowledgeable. Lorena and Giorgio in the Rock Shop are the best, their smile and professionalism made me come back to the shop and want to spend time there more. Gustaf (Gus) from Entertainment team at the pool is incredibly positive attitude, making people feel they have their best vacation. They work very hard for the customers, and honestly, they are the ones who made a difference in my vacation and me thinking to come back. HRH Cancun is lucky to have these guys on these teams. Thank you."

Because we checked in before 3 pm we had to go back to the front desk to retrieve room keys after 3.

There are kids clubs for the littler ones and a night club for the 18+ kids. The 14 and 17 year old felt there was just not much to do.         The waterpark was nice, but it looks bigger online. All the kids enjoyed it for about 1 hour. But once you ride the big slides a few times it got boring for them. The extra amenities that cost were bowling, the Escape Game and the game room. We only took part in the bowling which was fun. They have mini bowling and regular bowling. We did the mini bowling and it was only $10/person for 1 hour."

Location is small and a little dated but the service was top notch.  Christian and Robert on the entertainment staff were always around and were great fun.  Efrain was great at Zen.  It was our favorite restaurant.  Isla service was good but menu was pretty limited for us.   If you need a pool chair catch Tacho. He was always running and willing to help.  And lastly a big shout out to Principe  he dealt with all my wife’s crazy food request like a champ.   Overall we would highly recommend"

They use confuse messages in order to push the sell of the program. Very abusive, expensive and old. Food, not good enough and very selective between members and non members. You can have benefits at a very HIGH COST, beach beds, amenities and even good liquor."

Facilities are very clean and well maintained.  Freddy “Mercury” at the float pool bar was awesome.  All the staff was very friendly and helpful but had to give a shout out to Freddy for his above the top service and drinks.   We will definitely be staying again."
