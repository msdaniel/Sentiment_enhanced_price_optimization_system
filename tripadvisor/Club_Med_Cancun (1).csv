This resort is so much fun!  We went with a group of friends/co-workers for 4 nights, and absolutely fell in love with Club Med.  We stayed in a superior room in the Aguamarina section with a walk-out furnished verandah overlooking the ocean.  This was an ideal location for the water sports, tennis/pickelball courts, infinity pool (with walk-in entry), and one of the restaurants.  Shuttle service runs constantly between this area and the main beach/pool area.    We participated in several of the activities offered (snorkeling, pickleball, archery, kayaking, salsa dancing, sailing, cooking lessons, beach volleyball, bocce ball, ping pong, water volleyball, water basketball, musical performances, sunset cruise, turtle watching) and just didn't have time for all the"

We were able to do many of the activities without waiting and we got to meet so many of the GOs on a personal level - more than usual.  We travelled as a family of three with a young adult daughter - our third time here, but the first since COVID started. We met the Chief of The Village, Jose Luis, the first day of our trip and we were able to interact with him the whole week.

I'm an American and still felt right at home. Jose Luis was one of the best, as always, but what I really loved was the sailing. First time ever sailing was in the Sand Piper Resort in Florida... I think my instructor was Joshua? Anyways, when I went to Cancun, I got a refresher from Tony. This guy was so fun to relearn from. He said he didn't speak good English, but that was a total lie. His English was perfect. Ask for a lesson with him. The other sailor I learned from was Paulo. He was the all-time best Sailor I have ever seen in my life. I watched him on the Hobie16 that HE himself rebuilt and it was practically a spiritual experience. You won't meet a finer Sailor in your life. If you go to Cancun, go sail. That is all I have to say."

Family oriented in every aspect. Kids club is a must, the staff (Lilu, Adre, and the other gentlemen in the king hat) were perfect with the kids and provided a very structured fun environment for them.  Very very minimal seaweed on the beach and the club made tremendous efforts to clean any that came ashore. The food met our expectations at the time and then exceeded them at times. The only negative I can really speak of is snorkeling. We have 3 children that could not snorkel around the reef because there were red flags out the entire time. Even on days that the water seemed calmer, the flags never changed. This was a huge disappointment for me and my children because it what we looked forward to the most. Sometimes I felt that the flag never changed"

I have visited several Club Meds, from Egypt (sadly now closed) to St. Moritz to ski, to Punta Cana to party and Cancun to share with my girls.  When you enter any Club Med resort you feel like you are home, it's not a big tall hotel, it's the small apartments, the beatiful manicured gardens, the art in the walls inside and outside, the cleaneliness, the included entertainment, the shows, the GOs, and then the gastronomy gurus and their staff.

It was so nice not to have to plan everything myself, but still have options.   Food: PHENOMENAL. I even used precious stomach space on salads at the buffet, because the food is that good. The main restaurant is Hacienda, done buffet style, but this is not your usual sterno-lighters under aluminum tray kind of buffet, no no. The food was on individual plates, done artistically, and was amazing food even outside of a buffet setting. We stayed for four days, and the food was different each night, and included things like skirt steak, seared scallops, beef wellington, chicken cordon bleu, ceviche, etc."

We also enjoyed the very impressive nightly entertainment and the nightly group line dancing parties. I personally wish there were more Reggaeton (Zumba-type) music overall for dancing in the bar after the organized group dancing (rather than techno) and that it would be played in public areas during the day (rather than American pop songs) - it creates a Caribbean party atmosphere (such as we experienced at Punta Cana).

I’ll start with the bad so that we can end on a good note… The club med app is very frustrating. You can spend a lot of time looking for information that you will never find. And then you have to track someone down to get an answer to your question.  More of a waste of time than it is helpful.   We received an email message from Club Med to book spa services online now because they fill up quickly.  Booking in advance would give us a 10% discount.

The sheer quantity of activities available is truly top-notch at Club Med! The Ocean is the perfect temperature and you could stay in at all day if you have the right sun protection! The fact that sailing snorkeling and even trapeze flying is included is really special for families. The food service was lovely and Roldolfo made the best salad with kindness at Taco Arte. Overall a great place for a family vacation my only watch out is it does not include room service which was a surprise for us. If you have young children that get overheated such as babies also might not be the time to come in July. As there is not a swim up bar with shade in the pool And most of the meals are not"

Sadly my wife and I could not relax fully as beats music was everywhere, sometime even overlapping between areas :(. A real nightmare for people like us who just wish to relax, enjoy a nice book while listening to the lapping of the waves. Food was good, diverse and fresh, and we never got sick.  Kids club was okay but our son (6 yo) didn't enjoy much the activities. Those with water scared him as GOs seem to assume kids of his age knew how to swim. Our son doesn't and no swim vest or floaties were ever proposed to him. We wish GOs could have grouped kids based on their ability to swim or not,"

The resort is a bit spread out, but shuttle golf carts on a schedule helped with that, and a benefit was you could find some space to get away to a private spot on the beach.  Our oldest really liked the kid camp and Lilou even recognized him while we were from the first day he was there later on, which helped him be excited to go back!"

The best snorkeling location in Cancun as well as a great sandy beach, no other resort has both to my knowledge. Rooms are great, food caters even to picky eaters and the child club let you enjoy some me time while on vacation. We will be back!"

My husband and I and our sons ages 7&10 found something new to do every day which everyone enjoyed. From the snorkeling to sailing, swimming in the pools, and exploring the beaches, we could not have been more pleased with our vacation. I want to put a special shout out to the trapeze team, Ximena, Coco, Paulo, and Robinho! They were top notch instructors, patient and incredibly encouraging 💚 10 out of 10 I would go back just for the trapeze experience."

The food was terrific with a ton of variety. Taco arte had the best lunches! The aquamarina pool was refreshing, great drinks and views. The main beach was beautiful and a hidden gem was the taco arte beach in the afternoon.   Wanted to shout out to a few favorites this trip: first, thank you to Coco, Paulo, Ximena and Robinho for making my trapeze skills excel during my stay and had the best time.   And to Charlotte the best trainer ever!! She had the best workouts and so upbeat and fresh.   Also, we did the chichen itza and the cenota excurision which was fantastic. The details of the history and tour guides as informative, got there early to beat the crowds and felt very safe."
