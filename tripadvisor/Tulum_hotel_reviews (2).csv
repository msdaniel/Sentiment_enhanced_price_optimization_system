It exceeded all expectations! The staff is so friendly (thank you Emily, Icker, JP & Carlos!), the property is absolutely stunning and the service was incredible. We can't imagine staying anywhere else when we visit Tulum again. We stayed in a Jungle Suite, a comfortable & beautiful room tucked away in a corner of the property. Communicating with the staff through WhatsApp was so easy, and they were always very responsive, whether we needed to change our car service to the airport or needed a drink on the beach. Breakfast every day was delicious. La Valise is simply paradise!"

The property is absolutely beautiful, with very tasteful decor, a lot of open spaces and stylish rooms.  The staff went above and beyond to make us feel at home: they always greeted us with a smile, they always remembered our names, they helped us make restaurant reservations and find fun excursions to do.  We are especially thankful to Carlos, who greeted us with a smile every morning and made sure we always had whatever we needed when we were out on the beach.  Their food is fantastic too!  It is very tasty and healthy.  I can't say enough good things about this hotel, I would love to go back as soon as an opportunity arises."

The resort is beautiful, the staff is helpful and friendly and the food and drink is very good.  It’s a very intimate and quiet setting, very different from the large resorts in other beach resort areas.  The natural look and feel of the resort is relaxing, just a peaceful place to spend time and get away from our busy work life.  Whatever it is that we asked or needed, the service staff was there to help.  Reservations, recommendations, transportation etc…all taken care of by the exemplary staff.  I can’t wait to go back."

Emily and Josefina at the Concierge desk were absolutely on point with helping us set up airport transport, restaurant reservations, scooter rental, in-room/beach/pool dining and every other aspect of our trip that made our stay absolutely seamless. The property itself is breathtaking and unlike anywhere else we have ever stayed. You feel like you are staying in a good friend's home.

La Valise is an oasis of calm, but still close enough to participate in all the nightlife Tulum has to offer. We loved it!"

I was tempted not to write a review, to avoid sharing this hidden gem with the world.

The décor is impeccable and just blends in perfectly with the surroundings.   Every morning, we enjoyed breakfast on the terrace with views of the white sandy beach and the ocean. The breakfast is definitely a hightlight. Not just for the quality of the food (the home-made granola is fantastic), but the quality of the service.

Upon arrival, we walked over to look at La Valise and explore the beach (as it was included as part of our stay at Radhoo).   While we were aware that we had arrived at the tail end of seaweed season we were surprised that the beach was not only covered in it, but the stench made it impossible to sit and relax and the water was unswimmable.   According to La Valise's Instagram page, what we were seeing did not add up.

There could be more clarity on the site re Jungle Side vs Jungle facing, etc. to really understand the geography of the place. We had a jungle facing room that overlooked some trash and trees, but moved to a beach side room that was amazing.   All in all a wonderful trip."

Where to begin.. firstly the hotel is stunning and surrounded by huge plants giving us great beach vibes. Our room was stunning and nothing like we've ever experienced- my favourite the hammock and sweet welcome arrival (treats left in our room every evening). Oscar and Becky were the best concierge and always helped with any inquiries or bookings we had. A big shout out to the lovely Annai (I hope I spelt her name correctly) as she gave us excellent service. The service by all the staff were phenomenal and they were always accommodating- 5 star service. We had access to the Radhoo pool which is one of the biggest on tulum beach.

The concierge also scheduled for us a great, private tour of the Mayan ruins and two cenotes, which we definitely recommend. The hotel located a ways down from the hustle and bustle of Tulum, so it is nice and quiet but just a short walk from some great restaurants.   Thank you to all of the amazing staff!

The room was so well kept- and the bed and pillows, I could’ve slept all day but did not want to miss out on lounging in the sun under the cute cabanas. I scoped out others resorts and this was divine. They even leave little treats at night! Paradise- amazing location to unwind or spend time with friends or a loved one!!"

The staff is beyond wonderful; the owner Jimmy along with manager Mara, Bear and chef Pepe felt like family by the end of the week.

Although you can get around just fine using taxis, and driving the beach road can be…a bit of an adventure, we’d advise renting a car—which you’ll want to do anyway if you’re planning on getting out to see the cenotes or ruins, or dining in Tulum Pueblo.  Olas Tulum is exactly as advertised and very much lives up to its great"

We could not have chosen a better place to get away from it all after being cooped up at home for the past year!  Olas is tucked away on a quiet stretch of the beach road, away from the “scene” in Tulum. The view and proximity to the ocean cannot be beat. We did opt for one night out on the town but mainly stayed in, enjoying the sound of the waves and cool breeze from our spacious balcony. What a way to relax!  What also makes Olas special are the people you will meet. We love sharing the communal table with other guests and hearing their stories. And Chef Fernando is so warm and extremely talented. What a treat to taste (and see) his inventive breakfasts every morning. Tip: you must try the prawn tacos"

We stayed in the ocean suite with balcony. The room was simple yet spacious. Loved the view, breeze, and sound of waves with the sunrise stirring us awake in the morning (easy transition to the balcony hammock). The staff was very nice and so helpful with excursion recommendations.Meals were so fresh and delicious. The sunsets on the rooftop with amazing jungle views was the perfect aperitif to heading out for dinner.  Won’t wait another 10 years to return!"

The hotel is perfectly located with jungle around it and directly adjacent to the beach. The hotel is a bit secluded so you get peace and quiet, without traffic and without beach clubs.   We stayed in a larger room directly facing the sea with a large spacious patio. The room was clean and fresh. At night we opened the doors to the sea and fell asleep to the waves crashing against the beach. The cool wind made the room always cool and nice.   Dino who received us was super nice and very helpful. He did that little extra throughout our stay. He knows the best restaurants and bars and really made sure we enjoyed ourselves 100%. It wouldnt have been the same without him.  Mari in the kitchen made the best breakfast every morning filled with love. Do not"

I'm so glad we chose Olas! Tulum has really grown a lot in the past few years and it was nice to be away from the crowds and action. The property is just gorgeous and steps from a pristine beach. Our room was lovely and well appointed. The hosts, Dino and Abby, were amazing and so friendly to talk to each day at breakfast - as were the other guests. It felt like a home away from home. Breakfast is included in the rate and their cook is wonderful - so much so that we ordered lunch every day at the hotel, too. Thanks Olas - and especially Dino and Abby - for making us feel welcome and taken care of."

Beach and swimming wonderful. Has such a friendly low key atmosphere. Food and communal dining were great. Had a wonderful tour in the biosphere. Only downside was our room - junior suite. Choose a better one, they’re much nicer"

Magic place, exceptional crew and food. We found our dream place on earth. You wake up and fall asleep to the sounds of waves. In between, you have a beach so beautiful that it looks like a retouched postcard. But it is real."

Every part of our stay was a unique and incredible experience.  I still dream of the sounds of the ocean that fill your room at night. Everything at Los Olas is done with such attention to quality and beauty.  The staff is exceptional and made a point of going the extra mile to ensure that our stay was the best it possibly could be.  From the delicious food to sipping homemade pina Coladas on the beautiful beach, to the mezcal tasting while watching an incredible sunset, to the beautiful grounds – I highly recommend staying at Las Olas! I will be back!"

The beach is private and quiet.  The food and hospitality are amazing.  The staff helped us get reservations at highly desirable restaurants in town. We have returned three times and love it here.  We cannot wait to escape the cold weather in Boston and head back to Las Olas!"

The breakfast were amazing and the rooms perfect. The position is really away from all the noise and craziness of Tulum on a gorgeous beach were we saw no one else than the other few couples staying. This is really boutique and for people looking for a more original way of spending vacation time. You can walk to few really good restaurant. Abby was super helpful and the staff on site is like family and very lovely people."
