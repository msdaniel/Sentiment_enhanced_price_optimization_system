If you are vegetarian, or heaven help us, vegan, your choices for your visit are going to be very limited. Questions about the ingredients of a dish are met with blank stares.   Overall, I liked my visit. The grounds are beautifully maintained. The Spa is remarkably over priced!! I think every one means well, but a few areas are missing.   Having alcohol part of the all-inclusive isn't always a good thing. I saw way too many visitors totally blotto, and acting like complete jerks."

Started coming in 2004.  My friends that travel with my husband and me are in complete agreement that in the future we will look for an all adult resort. The rooms are clean, the food good. Atmosphere wonderful and tropical. However, we are past wanting to be around tons of screaming. Unattended children.  We understand the bottom line of any business is bring in as many as you can. We don't begrudge iberostar. We also don't begrudge families for bringing their families. However, there's precious little for teenagers to do here at the resort and I feel sorry for them here. They can sit on their phone at home. Pool chairs have pool toys on them overnight saving for the chairs day after day, never giving anyone else a"

The dive shop is located right on site.  They offer 2 morning dives and 2 afternoon dives every day which allows for lots of flexibility for scheduling.  The Iberostar is the farthest hotel south on the island and is right on top of the best dive spots.  If you do a two tank dive, they actually come in to the dock in between dives so you can go to the bathroom and get a water or soda.  Most boat rides to the top sites were 15 minutes or less.  Great boats and dive shop.  The resort is great, it's laid out in little 4 room buildings so it feels very private.  Each has a deck with a hammock.  The beach and pool were great, we were always able to find a comfortable spot (Mid December so hotel may not have been full).  The food was"

The diving was amazing.   We went to the fitness area everyday and met Manola Carmona. He was extremely knowledgeable about fitness but also the right way to train since he is also a licensed physical therapist. He took the time to map out the best exercises  for us, took us through the routine and sent us an email so we could continue at home. I expected to just have a nice workout with friends and left with a great plan that will help me in the future. I highly recommend stopping by the fitness center or one of his classes!!"

Over 20 of us were here for a week and couldn't ask for a better time. The hospitality and service was great. We enjoyed sitting at the beach, meeting new people and in the evening enjoying the shows provided by the resort. They have many fun activities that anyone can do. Gabriela and Alberto really know how to have fun with the crowd and keep us engaged. There are shows and games in the lobby almost every night. Don't be afraid to get involved. They might ask you to sing but don't be afraid, DJ Nancy has got your back. The bartenders and waitresses/waiters are better than any I have seen. Always checking in on you and your drink.

Some positives: the bungalow style resort and rooms make for a charming and quaint vibe. The entertainment at night was always fun and a wide variety from including the guests as the stars or bringing in live music/shows. The resort and rooms were clean. The amenities such as the gym were nice, we did not make it over to the spa. You could rent water sports (kayak, snorkeling) for 5 dollars for a 2 hour window.   The cons: if you are looking for a beach where you can get in and out of the water freely than this is not the resort for that, not many reviews talk about the rocky natural of the resort. You can swim in the ocean but you must walk down the dock to get there (or bring water shoes)."

Have to say that since 2017 it has only improved. The most significant improvement we saw was in the food department. We ate at the smokehouse twice, the first time the brisket was literally some of the best I've had, the second time it was a bit dry, but still good and the chicken, pulled pork and sides were all very good each time. One place of possible improvement would be the Mexican restaurant, didn't feel the food stood out here the way it did at the smokehouse or asian. The water stations are a nice addition, though some were out of order, the one in front of our room worked well. With so many using reusable containers, a possible addition could be a station to wash out bottles. After a 7 day stay you would feel better about a clean bottle after"

It’s beautiful, amazing food, activities to do all day. The only thing I regret is not finding Daniela and Gabriela on our last day to say goodbye! They made this vacation even more fun and felt like family to us! They remembered our names all week and we learned about each others families. They were so much fun and on top of the location, i will miss them dearly. Fabian was also great-fun and taught us about the animals! Can’t forget Jose in the shop at the front! He took so much time explaining the different chocolates and what different candies were put out during Dia de Muertos. He was so patient and oh so kind.

They changed their menu about seven months ago and it is now a family style restaurant featuring pulled pork, beef brisket, pork sausage, and lemon chicken thighs. It was a complete and total disappointment as we were looking forward to an evening with a nice steak dinner at what the Iberostar considers to be  one of its upscale restaurants.  For what it’s worth you’re better off eating at the main dining restaurant and having a wider variety of food. Do not waste your time at this restaurant."

This was our fourth visit in several years. We like this resort because it is smaller than some and mostly oriented toward adults since it is a magnet for Scuba divers and snorkelers.  Everything was great again this year. The grounds are well kept. Our room was well maintained and clean. Food at the various restaurants was much better than than previous visits but it was always good.

Negative: There were two days during our stay where buses of ""cruise ship guests"" were dropped off at the front to use the resort.  When this occurred, there were ZERO chairs at the beach or the pool.  In addition, it created long lines at the beach bar and the beach grill ran out of food.

The ocean was quite rocky near the beach and yes there is a lot of ""ocean"" washed up near the beach so it isnt super clear in the shallow area.

Iberostar has many snorkel and scuba trips right out of the resort with their own boats. Easy to book day of arrival and so convenient, the reefs were right next to the resort. Cris is an amazing instructor/guide. The crew and staff are all 5⭐️ at this all inclusive Iberostar Hotel. All 4 of us were never ever’s scuba people. We took advantage of their free scuba pool trial at 10:30am. Cris was precise in her delivery, competent, charming and beautiful.

The staff was super super nice, helpful, smiling  Our little girl did some activities at the kid club, thanks to Montserrat, Ismael and Rosa she had great time! I would suggest to walk around the pools or beach before starting an activity to have more participants, as well as having a “teen group” with some more challenging activities: discover diving, discover bow and arrow, beach volley games, as the kid club is only until 12 years old.

There was a small amount along the shoreline one morning but staff had it cleared away quickly.  Some people have had negative comments on the condition of the wharf but I'm pleased to say that repair work was underway during our stay.  Overall, a good choice for a week in Cozumel."

The Good Food- this was the best buffet I’ve seen in a long time. Plenty of veggies and fresh fruit for the health conscious, lots of options for different dietary needs, and it was all tasty. They had some kind of ceviche almost every day which was awesome. Layout - it’s in a jungle kind of environment and it’s beautiful. Lots of chances to see the resident wildlife (coati, flamingos, parrots, peacock). And it’s not huge, so it’s an easy walk to restaurants and dive shop (and if walking is challenging they have golf carts to assist). Beach - gorgeous. Stunning layout and great to watch sunsets!

We were greeted with big smiles and “buenos dias!” throughout the day by all staff and management. Such nice people! We had exceptionally friendly service from servers Esperanza (Cuzamil), Isabel (Gaviatas), lobby bartender, Misael, and all of the servers at the lower level pool bar. The cleaning staff did an outstanding job on our room every day.   We’re scuba divers and chose this resort because there is a dive shop on property (Pro Divers International - see separate review on TA).

The resort has a boutique like feel - small, elegant and cozy.  The cleanliness is evident throughout and the staff are all incredibly wonderful. I cannot give enough credit to ALL THE STAFF working at this resort.  From the moment of check in right through to check out.  Every day of our stay, they all greeted us with genuine friendly smiles - from the housekeepers to the gardiners.

Usually when I book an all-inclusive resort, I expect a gated entrance as a bit more of protection as I am traveling in another country. Some hotels in Cozumel have that large gate. This one does not. It is closer to civilization and is not as secluded. Also, expect alot of stairs and ramps when staying at this property. When it rains, this gets dangerous very quickly.   Food: The food is just ok and the buffet is at least located indoors away from most insects. If you are on a vegan diet, then the buffet is where it is at for you. You will always have fresh fruit, sautéed vegetables, and potatoes there. There is also an omlette bar and a tostada station at breakfast.

In fact, probably just the fact that the resort is in need of a facelift. Everything else was perfect.  We'd been told ahead of time that the staff is what makes Cozumel so special, and it is 100% true.  Our Diamond Concierges Nina and David (at the pool) exceeded our expectations; we could not ask for better attention.  We're low-key pool people (day-drinking is a distant image in our rear-view mirror!) but whenever we did need anything Jossie, Alan, Gabriel, Jairo and Jorge were always right there.  Breakfast and lunch were always highlighted by the attention of Heri, Enrique, Marco, Calos, Julio, Fili and Sarahy.  All were great but if we were to single one out it would be Heri. He is a tremendous asset to Palace.  Martha"

After agreeing to attend a 90 min presentation, we ended up becoming members. We were told we would receive 20-30% off rates compared to any website or through any third party. We were pressured to buy membership at a level that would allow us to book family suites at the discounted rate. However, as soon as we got home, I tried to look at booking a week in the loft suite at Cozumel Palace and the price was actually slightly higher on the “member-only” preferential rate website than I could get on hotels.com."

They need to invest some money into this resort to have the rooms and buildings keep up with the great food and service."

My family of 4 and our group of 17 stayed for 1 week ( April 1st - 8th) and everyone had a good time.  I am going to evaluate my experience. Food- 4/5. The food was pretty good.  We liked Momo Asian restaurant best.  Antonio was the best server/ waiter on the resort.  He was very patient and professional. Room- 4/5 The room was nice however the jacuzzi is kinda wasted space unless you absolutely love jacuzzis.  Bathroom was good.  I would’ve preferred 2 queens instead of doubles. Decent view from floor 3 Gym-  2/5 Unfortunately the worst gym because of space and equipment.  Not much in there and a treadmill wasn’t working when we were there Drinks- 3/5 Drinks were kinda watered down.  I asked for a floater(extra shot) on most drinks."

We also chose to have premium rooms and had access to the premium lounge.  Let me tell you the guys that work in this lounge are so attentive.  Great coffee, lunch and great drinks.  Thank you Christian, Floricel, Luis and Alfredo. Rooms are plain but very clean.  We found the beds to very comfy. Beach was great and the pool areas were always clean.  We usually don't return to the same resort but we are already talking about retuning"

It's nothing fancy but for the price you have everything you need,  good drinks, food, beach, pools and the beds were very comfy.  As a mom of 3 I just loved that i didn't have to cook or clean up after my kids for a week and got to sit on a beach drinking a pina colada instead.  I also loved the variety of Mexican, Argentinean and European families we met!  There was the rowdy American crowd decked out in all their American flag shirts - as if anyone could mistake them for anything else -  but they tended to herd together on one side of the beach which we avoided."

Not a big beach area and part of it where there are trees is great for shade but kind of hard to get into and out of the water.

I really liked the Mediterranean and Seafood restaurants. And in general, it is very nice to have lunches and dinners by the sea."

This resort choice was not usual for us because we like to beach walk, kayak and ocean swim. We chose this vacation realizing it was out of the norm for us because of; the 4 hr direct flight from Toronto, Ontario, very short transfer from airport to hotel and good value for the price. We were very happy with our vacation despite the differences from our usual trips south. We're not scuba divers but clearly this was a popular base for many divers. We found the in and out of multiple giant cruise ships and smaller boats  interesting rather than irritating. We did notice road noise in our room and on the beach but it did not keep us awake. Our room had a partial ocean view"

My husband, 12 and 9 year old kids enjoyed snorkeling in the water. We have seen several reviews about poor food prior to coming. We would say it has more to do with your taste and preference. In our group of 11 there were some who loved something each night at meals and others who did not. You can only order room service once per day for free and after that there is a charge which is unfortunate especially when traveling with kids or in a room with 6 people.

Our room had a shared door with the adjacent room so the soundproofing wasn’t great. The shower sometimes would sometimes run brown but that seemed to sort itself out. There is also a yappy dog next door (not in any way the hotel’s fault).  Any issues were offset by the great price of the hotel. If we return to Cozumel we would stay here again.   Also, I"

I was directed  to walk four blocks with my SCUBA gear and luggage?! I was, however, met 2/3 of the way by an employee.

We paid substantially more for the preferred level.  The Dreams people openly said there were a lot of kids at the Dreams pool so they came over to Secrets which is adults only.  It might be OK to go to the standard level pool at Secrets, but they let them come"

BIG MISTAKE!! For being a luxury resort it really is far from it. The rooms are in rough shape and we stayed preferred. The food was not that great a few things were good like the wings in the preferred lounge and the Alfredo at the pizzeria. There was water dripping from the bathroom ceiling, phone next to the bed did not work so you had to go to the bathroom and use that phone, the free $200 resort money is a joke! You can’t use it at the gift shops or activities only on stuff that you spend an arm and leg on it’s not worth it! The staff is super super nice but we got pressured to do the 90"

But if you are accustomed to nice places, this is the pits. First of all, the ""preferred"" pkg isn't worth it.  The check-in took 1 hour in the ""preferred"" bar/lounge with snacks that had been out all day and was a hike to get to.  You receive $200 in voucher credits to apply in resort, BUT, can only use one per event, so only $20 applied to $200 spa, etc. The ""host"" pressured us to attend the Hyatt vacation club 90 min sales pitch. Told her we weren't interested but she found us at breakfast and followed me to confirm our return airport shuttle. Still hounding me. Finally firmly said NO. The suite was ocean front, 3rd floor with 2 balconies, with a HUGE palm tree totally blocking any"

He got a preferred room because he read the reviews that the non preferred rooms were not that great and didn't want us staying in something like that on a vacation.   Cue the first day we get there. Check in isn't until 3pm, but we could go enjoy the resort. Hungry we went to the Oceana. Mom got the fish and I decided to try the seafood meatballs. The latter was basically cat food and you cannot convince me otherwise. I took 3 bites because my motto is I have to really try it before I decide I do not like it, but they were horrid. My mom's fish was OK, but that was at best.   The room was ready.  The room we had is nice and the location of it was really"

Check in took 1 hour, she apologized and stated that she would see what she could do to get us something to compensate for that long wait. Never heard back. The “Preferred” amenities list a few things that were actually nowhere to be found and I brought that up to them with no reaction: “Complimentary computer access (none), Daily continental breakfast service (was there but totally gross), Afternoon hot and cold hors d’oeuvres (was there but totally gross)” There’s a very nice app for your phone that tells you on a daily basis which restaurant is open, activities, etc. Fantastic idea. Problem is that the information on the app is wrong 90% of time. And the sheet they give you weekly is also not much accurate. So, we ended showing up at restaurants that"
