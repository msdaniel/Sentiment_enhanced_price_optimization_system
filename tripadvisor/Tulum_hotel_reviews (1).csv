Highly recommend the Sea Villa. Most beautiful room I’ve ever experienced. Also went to KinToh for the Monkey nest experience for dinner & we had Luis Miguel as our server & he was always on top of it. Very knowledgeable & personable. Highly recommend requesting Luis Miguel as your server if you ever go to KinToh for dinner. I will no doubt come back to this beautiful resort."

Absolutely unreal. Truly. From the first step into the resort and into our villa, we were totally mind blown. We cancelled our excursions and just stayed at the hotel and enjoyed the spa services (Samanta and our masseuses were amazing), activities at the resort, the private beach, and the different hot tubs in the villa. The food was also delicious. The tarot card reading and inner child meditation were fantastic. Hugo was above and beyond helping with reservations, transportation, and everything in between. He was always at the ready and so quick to help! Truly a five star experience in the jungle. We’ll be back."

The privacy, the ceremonies was unforgettable.  We also enjoyed the spa and massages with one of the most experienced therapists.

It is incredibly expensive. I mean, we spend real cash on good vacations, but this place is crazy, and the service was not good at all. If you are paying 22/25 USD for 1 drink and 60 for an entrée, you expect spectacular service, and this wasn't the case. We were taking pictures at the nets and hammocks when we had the ugliest and most disgusting experience. We realized that a man was staring at us in a bad way. It was uncomfortable and awkward. At first, I thought that it was only me seeing that guy, but then my friends told me exactly the same. The worst part is that he is part of the staff, a man with really short hair in a black shirt. He didn't have a name"

When we first arrived Marisol gave us a tour. I pulled her aside and mentioned I had plans to propose and wanted a photo shoot to capture the moment. She was super excited and got it all setup within just a few hours. The next day everything went as planned and we couldn’t ask for a more magical moment. Later that afternoon we went back to the room and it was decorated with rose petals with a bottle of wine ready for us to celebrate. My Fiancé and I would like to thank Marisol from the bottom of our hearts… we hope to see her and her beautiful smile again soon! We stayed in a Sea Villa and the view was amazing.

However the beach club is average at best, for the $200 USD we paid for the day we were very disappointed with the basic beach club offerings. The DJ finally showed up at around 1 pm and you could barely hear the music, the beach area itself is not exciting or posh. Also, beware of the scam the servers run, we asked for Stoli vodka cocktails and were charged for Grey Goose on our bill- this is unacceptable and in Tulum this was not our first encounter with this scam. Thankfully after spending 45 minutes with the manager we left with a $100 refund."

For once, the photos don't do it justice. The villas emerge from the trees and sit beautifully and comfortably alongside them. The museum is a rare and surprising treat. The staff and experiences are all truly magical from the welcoming Mayan ritual (original scpetic/massive convert; honestly) to the incredible massage by the Caribean Sea. However, for us there is only one star of the show: Luis. He was incredible - there was nothing too small that he hadn't sorted for us, whether that be the best table at the hotel's incredibel restaurants, arranging our cabana every day and of course sorting our cool bikes so we could explore.

On the one hand, this property is insanely unique and beautiful. The restaurants are so well designed, the staff is amazing, the food delicious. On the other, I would not stay at this hotel a second time.  Check in was easy, they valeted our car, took our bags, checked us in and gave us a tour, everyone was very friendly and helpful.   The store at the entrance is beautiful. The design and architecture is like nothing I have ever seen. Check it out.   Now, lets start with the entrance to the hotel, the wood logs that make up the bridge and pathway to get in and out are so cute, but next to impossible to walk on.

My husband and I celebrated our honeymoon there and had a wonderful time! The angel service is top notch; Marisol, Areli, Karen, and Regina were attentive, friendly, and very helpful. The on-site restaurants are delicious! We particularly enjoyed our daily breakfasts at Kin Toh. We enjoyed a few different spa treatments, the traditional Temezcal experience and had an insightful tarot reading from Federico. We did find the beach club a bit over priced and could have done without the jungle trance music but we always had an enjoyable time. Plus, there are a ton of shops and restaurants in walking distance from the hotel. Above all, waking up to the sunrise over the ocean and being immersed in nature was the very best part."

The concierge team is called the Angels. For your stay, you get assigned with an “angel”. Our angel was Hugo and he was by far the best angel we could ever ask for. Extremely motivated and keen to give us the best experience ever. He was at our service 24/7, he took amazing care of us and booked us all the dinners and night clubs outside Azulik throughout the whole stay.

In 2009, this was a rustic, laid-back place in a sleepy village. Now Tulum is completely overdeveloped and so is La Zebra. The buildings are packed very tightly next to each other, so there are rooms which are better and worse - some lack privacy. It still is a nice place though and we enjoyed the seaview room with a balcony overlooking the restaurant, as well as one of the more private jungle room with a plunge pool (on the right hand side of the property). The restaurant is pretty good and really stands out where it comes to breakfast - there are simply no better breakfast burritos and acai bowls in Tulum.

Tip: Ask Carlos for restaurant suggestions his suggestions were spot on !"

The suites are well appointed and absolutely beautiful!  The beach is well cared for and the cabanas are a huge plus.  Although the beach is public, it feels private, especially in the evenings.  The food is great and I can’t say enough positive things about the service.  Jonathan was our server both on the beach and in the restaurant and he was very attentive, kind, and helpful.  He made our experience extra special.  We traveled with another family and our kids found the resort to be just as enjoyable as we did.  Will definitely return."

We booked for three, they gave us a beach bed for two and said we would have to pay for another beach bed, so one of our guests just sat on a chair all day.

We found out that one of the pieces of furniture was moldy and smelled pretty bad, and my wife was very sensitive to it.  First thing in the morning we called the manager (Muntse) (sp?) and she came in with like, 8 guys and took it out, brought in a dehumidifier and everything was very pleasant after that.  A little later that day, we were at the beach and were surprised by a bottle of Sauvignion Blanc, which we enjoyed and which made the whole day better (of course)!

Following yhis long period of time trying to courteously contact the hotel to resolve this legal undertaking, they have simply stopped responding to any communications.

Hotel Muare is a small resort that kept the jungle as part of their land scape. The bartenters are true mixoligests. I wish I connected with them on Facebook :) We are foodies and the food was very good. This is promoted as a wellness hotel but the menu fits any life style. The rooms are super private with your own plunge pool. The common pool area is one of the most inviting areas I have seen. We hope to go back soon..."

This is a very cozy, boutique hotel with lots of privacy and some rooms have a private plunge pool.  Ours did. which is one of the reasons we booked.     Here's an honest review and constructive feedback:  pros: -Beautiful property -nice/friendly kind staff -Rooms are very well designed and layout is great -Decor is beautiful  -Comfy bed and pillows -view out from bed is wonderful   cons:  -4 star pricing and 3 star service  - Rooms lacked the basics (ex. water in the mini bar needed a bottle opener but the room didn't have a bottle"

The drinks were great as well, I recommend the chak!  Some tips… this hotel is not very close to anything else, so come with what you need including snacks and medicines. Also try and plan your daily activities ahead of your stay so that you can enjoy all the time you have. Finally give the yoga a try, it was lovely."

Every aspect of this resort is fantastic, the rooms are really well-appointed with lots of space (we had a 2 bedroom suite with 2 bathrooms), the food, beach, and pools are excellent. But above all, the staff is amazing. They work so hard and are so cheerful. Mr. G, Victor Manuel, Pablo, Eder, Candela, Carlo and Fernando went out of their way to make sure we had a magical stay. The entertainment is wonderful and fun for all. I loved the foam party and fire dancing! My only suggestion would be to have more affordable excursions around the area. Most excursions with the exception of the temazcal excursion are too expensive. I can’t wait to go back to Gran Tulum. Thank you so much."

The restaurants are all really good so well worth booking ahead of arrival.  If you can ask for an updated room as they’re much better. It is a perfect place for a family holiday.   Advice  You can check in on the hotel app 10 days before and you can then book tables at the a la carts. You need your passports and the scanner in the app is tricky. Once checked in you can find your number in my account then my info then next to booking. You can then book tables and add other rooms (max 6 people).

A few nights ago he supposedly helped us make a dinner reservation. This evening, he said he had no record of it, and was extremely rude. Honestly, just ridiculous. I also called about the Air Conditioning and had to call 7 times to get someone to come check it. It feels like most people have an attitude when you ask them to do anything.

I guess this is enough of a revenue generator for the resort so it would be highly unlikely that the resort would relocate them.

It's a waste of money and staff is not very accommodating. We vacationed at Bahía Principe Tulum from May 4-May 8, 2023. Tremendously awful experience! The statt at hotel along with third party company used to book airport shuttle stole my money! Not only were they extremely late for pick up at airport, I had to pay an additional $250 to return to airport when I paid for full services. Third party company booked through hotel charged me for full services when I only received partial service. I have spoken to numerous staff members in order to get reimbursed and no one nas ottered any help. I work extremely hard for my money so I want it back Bahía Principe! Also,"

I couldn't say anything new that hasn't been said in other reviews. The building where we stayed was newly renovated, our group of thirteen members was accommodated in one building, room to room, five rooms, neat and clean every day. Sometimes it was not completely filled with towels, but there was no shortage. Unlike previous stays in this hotel, changes are visible for the purpose of savings, but at the expense of the guests. There was always enough and varied food, it's just a matter of individual taste, nobody went hungry for sure, Food trucks are a hit because you can overeat if you're not too hungry for lunch. The pools were clean, as were the sunbeds around the pool, enough space for all guests. It was a bit crowded on the weekend, but"

In April, when I needed to update the reservation and remove a room, it was literally hours of time attempting to reach someone on the phone when the ""My Bahia Principe"" online system did not work.

The pools were fantastic and the kid's club was great for my 2 year old son.   Transportation to and from the hotel were complicated for us since we booked a week prior to our stay. I wish the hotel would have at least provided us some options on that. Also, although the staff was super helpful, I did find some of staff to be overly fishing for tips, which is a little annoying on a vacation.

Being born and raised in New York, my tastebuds didn’t agree with 90% of the food available at the buffet. But what I will slam them on is the alcoholic beverages! They were so watered down, it was disgusting. Moving on to the entertainment……….there was none!. For 7 days I had to endure c rated bands performing songs strictly for older people.

The resort itself has an appealing atmosphere and it’s nice but here’s a few tips for anyone going. It’s really hard to make a reservation through the app to any of the restaurants, most of the time it’s fully booked. Out of the 6 days I stayed here I was only able to book 2 restaurants. The main buffet food is good at first but it gets old very fast, and very low quality. We kept receiving new towels from maid service and most of them had some stains, or dirty marks. The overall cleanliness of the room itself was fine. They have different events going on everyday which was a bonus to everything else.
