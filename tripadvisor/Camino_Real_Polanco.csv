And boy, are we glad we did. From a practical point of view, the hotels location is ideal, close enough to all the major sites and museums, but with just enough distance to be an oasis at the end of the day. My wife especially enjoyed the (heated) pool. while my 16 yr old son hit the gym every day. They have several restaurants and bars on sight, to be honest, we ate out most of the time, but I really enjoyed the breakfast buffet the one time we ate there. I had the Mexican dishes which were really good. My son thought the more traditional US food was so so. We were not pleased with our first room choice. We mentioned this right away and we were quickly"

The staff is very friendly and the renovated rooms are lovely. We especially appreciated the gym and took advantage of several onsite restaurants. The location is great if you're visiting the museums and the park but with CDMX traffic, traveling to Zocolo and the historic sites is time consuming from here."

Decided to give a second chance. Wish I didn’t   Place looks really tired and old fashioned. Check in was good. Once we were in our room the whole thing changed. We were placed in a room with absolutely no view. Yes. No view. And I’m not talking a roof or so. Place has no view. Not good if you at least like to see the sky.   Room is modest to say the least. I think this hotel carries and survives by reputation of better years.   Food at the restaurant ( Huerta? ) was not at adequate temperature. We decided to finish. We were starving.   Today we decided to stay in bed till 8 am. Impossible ! Every time someone uses the bathroom and shower, pipes make so much noise that is impossible to stay in rest.   Bathroom has no absorption of odor nor steam so if you take"

Thanks To Mr. Kirnbauer GM and his staff I had a very nice stay. The room was spacious and impeccable and the location was perfect. Close to main attractions and most important I felt safe. The taxi pick up  area is inside the hotel which I thought was brilliant. Thanks again for making a rather stressful and quick travel so much easier!! I recommend this hotel if you are looking to find relaxation and great sleep in a busy place like Mexico City."

However, after a ten year hiatus, am happy to say the standards of the hotel have not suffered.  The title of this piece says almost everything you need to know.

The rooms are boring corporate, but they have everything you need & are very clean and not expensive. The hotel absorbs people so despite hundreds of rooms it did not feel crowded. There’s a good pool.The architecture is supposedly by a famous Mexican architect, and features water. The concierges are extremely helpful, & went above & beyond to help us when we had a phone disaster. In fact all staff were friendly.  Not everything works however- like their credit card machines. Food is overpriced & not great value"

The hotel is very dated, rooms are old and run down. The check-in process is painful - the check-in staff are loathed to process your stay. This place is stuck in the 1970's. You can do a lot better."

This is quite expensive hotel but you have to pay extra even for bathroom robes or slippers, can you imagine? Rooms are clean but old and need to be refreshed.  For the money that they charge  per night is definitely not worthy compare to other hotels available in Polanco.  Total disappointment."

In the area where I was staying they were doing some repair and modifications, so during the day they had noise, which was not pleasant. Also, the building is too large and the service is very slow, even though you do see a lot of staff wandering round, if you ask for help, they dont necessarily give it. That also happened during breakfast, where they had many waiters but to get coffee from them for a second time it was quite the challenge, they were mostly cheking if you had already signed the receipt from breakfast. For the fare we paid, I dont consider this a good deal, I suggest you improve service and speed."

I am a long time customer of Camino Real chain but this was my first visit to the one located in Polanco Mexico City. Probably the best bathroom ive seen in years, confortable bed, decent breakfast buffet all would point out to a five star review BUT for one small but crucial detail; they decided to go against common sense and general practice in the industry and took away the cofee pot in the room. It ruined my morning routine  and when i complained at front desk they told me there was nothing they could do..Apalled"

First, the architecture is stunning and who can complain about the amazing artwork by Rufino Tamayo in the lobby?  Our rooms were all renovated and the Mexican hospitality we received from most of the staff....rooms attendants, porters, front door staff...was beyond gracious. Only the front desk check in staff were not very friendly, perhaps because this hotel is primarily a business hotel and our group was there on vacation. All meals we had, whether room service or in one of the restaurants, were excellent.  The concierge was excellent, able to arrange for in-room massages within one hour!

The architecture and art are interesting and the location is great. You can walk to many museums and tourist sites, which is definitely an advantage in Mexico City.  Our room had a nice patio, overlooking the courtyard. My only small complaint is that the housekeeping was a little inconsistent.  When we arrived, there were no shampoos in the bathroom and one day, they took the dirty towels away but didn't replace them.  But that was minor and it was rectified quickly when we asked for the items. Overall, a good experience."

Everyone mentions the art here, but it was lost on me. The hotel was clean, our room comfortable. The bathroom layout was odd, but nice shower with plenty of hot water and good toiletries. Several restaurants if you don't want to go out. We appreciated La Huerta with buffet or table service. Great location--across from entrance to Chapultapec Park with its variety of museums, lakes, zoo, and Chapultapec Castle. Lots of places to walk or run in the Park and around the hotel there are many shops, restaurants and convenience stores like Circle K where bottled water, soft drinks and snacks are cheap."

I went for Zona Maco. Was disappointed that even though they had rooms available, they would not let me check in early without paying an extra US$200. Really. The renovated room was actually quite nice - marble bathroom and all - but the large-screen TV was not level, by far. Bell-staff were diligent . This hotel is being renovated and they are reasonably discreet with how they handle that. I would only go if the price is reasonable."

We had previously booked one of the cute boutique hotels in Polanco but when we saw this hotel we moved immediately. First of all, it is a beautiful hotel with gorgeous, art-filled spaces. The location is excellent, in walking distance of the best museums and a short car ride (except in Mexico City's horrific rush hour traffic) of the good restaurants in Roma and La Condesa. The original rooms are spacious and stunning, with great bathrooms and lovely details like original wood closets. Ours looked out over a lovely courtyard with a pool that people were actually swimming laps in every morning. I recommend spending a little extra for the Club level rooms (about $60 USD) and having breakfast included in the 5th floor VIP"

It is classic beautiful architecture and a very nice area of Polanco walking distance to lots of shops and restaurants. My only complaint is about the beds. The double beds made it tight for family of four and the charge for an extra bed was almost half the cost of the room. They need to either get queen beds or make the charge for the extra bed nominal. Otherwise this is a great traditional hotel with amazing service and friendly staff."

The staff in the Beefbar were very noisy, did not seem to have been taught the appropriate way to address diners when speaking to them or in how to behave, and I think this has to be lack of training - or of knowledge - on the part of the restaurant manager who although present, did not ask his staff to be quiet.

However it is a hotel, not a museum, and in hotel services it leaves much to be desired.   Upon arrival, we needed a doctor and had a name and phone number. The first concierge we asked to make a call to the doctor because we do not speak Spanish, not only failed to help but also made us feel as if we were imposing on his time.  There were a number of frustrations, including our key cards being cancelled twice during our 10 day stay.    The most annoying occurrence was when we returned to our room at 3 pm on our last day to find the maid in our room. We asked her to leave and come back later as we were getting ready for an early dinner. When we returned at 6:30, the room was not made up. We called"

You can exchange dollars right at the front desk at going rate which was very convenient. The included breakfast at the Huerta was so incredible. first class food and service.

Perhaps not the most modern of places but still a nice experience.  Reception could be more welcoming, felt cold and busy dealing with other things. Check-in was a bit difficult for some reason - we booked a junior suite for more space to work and lounge, but as room window faced a wall we asked for another option - unhelpful reception made this process difficult, same throughout with every small issue eg reactivating room keys that kept getting inactivated for some reasons.  Felt like we were bothering them each time. Pool staff and exec lounge staff were great. Exec lounge was fine in terms of food choice and lounge area. Pool area is superb - ideal for a coffee while sitting back and working on your laptop.  Wifi"

The hotel has a fairly conservative feel. The common areas are spacious and well maintained. The rooms are also of a good size and quality of appointments, and they are very clean and well maintained.  This hotel is neither rustic nor over the top modern.
