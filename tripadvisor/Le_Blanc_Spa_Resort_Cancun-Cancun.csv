The exceptional experience offered by this establishment left us both spellbound and immensely satisfied. We were particularly impressed by the culinary delights served at all the restaurants, with Lumiere, the French eatery, and Terraza, specializing in Mexican cuisine, standing out significantly. Lumiere managed to captivate our taste buds with their exquisite chocolate soufflé, and the stellar service added a feather to their already illustrious cap. Terraza, on the other hand, amazed us with their chef's off-the-menu specials, providing a pleasant surprise to our gastronomical adventure.   The resort's butler service deserves special praise as well. Our heartfelt"

From the moment you arrive, you are welcomed by the smell of cucumber aroma in the lobby and a warm neck wrap. Every single person on staff is kind and welcoming.  We spent out days by the pool with an amazing pool staff that was so accommodating. Each afternoon Laura would come by with cucumbers and a washcloth for your eyes and provide a massage treatment. Laura is amazing!  Then you have people like Alexander at the third floor pool who goes above and beyond. Alexander was always there with a smile and even made a special run to get my wife her favorite salad. Edgar was another mvp, always checking to make sure we had the right drinks.

Management seems to go out Of their way to evaluate staff and look for how they can better care for your needs.  We have been to other all inclusive resorts that are less expensive. But you get what you pay for.   From the front desk where we checked in with Cynthia  to our butlers,  Saul and Jose everyone looks to make your trip a wonderful experience.   One of the reasons that I come back every year is for the experience in the mens spa. Pablo and Miguel take very good care of me.

Le Blanc is unlike any other resort we have stayed at. The staff and overall service is outstanding and our personal butlers, Eduardo and Brito were phenomenal and truly enhanced our stay. We asked for a bottle of champagne sent to our room one night after dinner and they went above and beyond by filling up our jacuzzi with bubbles, laid out rose petals, and delivered chocolate covered strawberries and ice cold champagne. Anything you can dream of, you can get here! We also enjoyed all the delicious restaurants, amazing poolside cocktails served by the most hardworking staff, and all the fun entertainment and activities they hosted.

At night our favorites are Yama where Elias arranged a feast at a rose petal covered table and brought Freddy the head chef to meet us and prepare a special final night dinner. We followed Manny our experienced waiter from Lumiere to Bella and put ourselves completely"

I felt like I was in a Dream being there. From the moment you are greeted its paradise. The grounds are beautiful, super clean and tranquil. The service is impeccable. Every single Staff that we encountered was so friendly and attentive. They have amazing management! The food Is outstanding. The only meal that wasn't outstanding was the steak house. The service was but they were out of filets and had to have a sirloin which wasnt fab but the waiter was soo apologetic and offered to get me anything that I wanted even if it came from another restaurant. The french restaurant was probably the best meal I had on any vacation there are no words that do it justice it was so off the chain. Its truly the best place I have been to. This was a much needed trip."

As we were checking out of le blanc, we were accosted by a sales person who convinced us to buy another week to use sometime later. The low price we paid for the 4 nights and 5 days seemed remarkable at $300 but, we were assured by the high-pressured salesperson that the amount was all we would have to pay.  Trust me, we asked every way possible to ensure an offere that sounded too good to be true, was.  Now when it comes time to book it, we discover it was only a down payment on a discounted price. Sorry, no refund, pony up $2,400 for 4 nights in Cabo.  What a scam that was!!!    Staying in the resort was amazing but, this makes us sorry we allowed ourselves to be hoodwinked!"

Terrassa has been our favorite for breakfast and  our dinner is really exceptional. The romantic dinner was fabulous and the service as impeccable. We spent every day on the beach in a canopy and it was fabulous with Jeanette and Mayra they were very attentive and made the experience perfect.. The atmosphere and the elegance of leBlanc hits you when you walk into the lobby and you can walk out and see the infinity pool as it appears to go into the ocean. It was perfect for couples getaway."

Le Blanc resort is more than a 5 star resort! From the moment you arrive and are greeted by staff (in this case Roberto who is the most professional and welcoming person) you know you are in good hands.  The check in was fast and efficient and our room was ready before check in time!  The rooms are immaculate and very large.  Every single staff member you meet will greet you and wish you a pleasant day.  There are people who went above and beyond for us.  I believe every staff member will, but these are the ones that made it special for us.  Our butlers, Gustavo and Joel.  They would call or text each  morning to see if we needed anything.  Their level of service was just top notch.  As far as restaurants, we ate at all of them and they"

The food, service, and staff are amazing, and the view of the beach is incredible. The resort and rooms are impeccably clean and beautiful - we always feel comfortable. Le Blanc is a small, boutique resort where the staff get to you know and become like family - but they still serve you with the utmost professionalism. Can't wait to go back!"

This was our second vacation to the resort this year due to how much we enjoyed our stay in March 2023. As someone who spent the majority of my adult life traveling on a shoe-string budget, as the saying goes, I never imagined I would choose a resort to spend a vacation. However, after the pampering we experienced from the phenomenal staff at Le Blanc Cancun, I am convinced this is the place to go if you need to recharge.   Starting with the transport service to and from the airport, everything we needed was handled expertly. If you have a stressful career, need a break from your kids, a romantic getaway where all you have to worry about is wearing enough sunscreen, drinking plenty of water, and what"
