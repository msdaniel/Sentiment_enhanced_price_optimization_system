We were introduced to our room in a way I have only seen a couple of times when I had the pleasure of staying at a 5+ star hotel. The buffet breakfast that was included in our price was a much better than expected value. Service wasn't as attentive as could have been, but the immediately responded to any request. Great Downtown location the rooftop hotel overlooks the plaza. We will definitely stay here again and again!"

Monica de La Rosa in charge of reservations with the help of  Mariana Reyes are always helpful and outstanding when booking. They do not miss a single detail no matter how small or big our group is.

It was a great experience. The hotel is beautiful, and the location cannot be beat – right on Zocalo square.  The outdoor covered terrace on the rooftop overlooked Zocalo and was a wonderful location for breakfast and late-night drinks.  The staff was gracious, especially one of the door stewards, Victor.  They helped us line up things to do and made good suggestions for restaurants and shopping. And, of course, we also spent time trying to see where parts of the James Bond film were shot!   There was nothing we did not dislike.  We stayed in a junior suite.  It would have been nice to have more than one capsule of caffeinated coffee in the room (we did get more at the front desk).  A nightly turn-down would also have been nice"

For a couples getaway we highly recommend the zocalo view suite. It is spacious and elegantly decorated with historical style. We enjoyed  breakfast and most evening meals at the hotel, and can say only good things about the food, service, and atmosphere at the restaurant and throughout the hotel.

But Gran Hotel Ciudad de Mexico is the wonderful exception that proves the rule. I came for the stained glass ceiling. But they don't just cash in on the ceiling as a gimmick - throughout the entire stay, they make you feel like a million bucks (apologies to readers who are worth more than a million bucks). They give you champagne when you check in, and have a plate waiting in your room with treats and your name written in chocolate. I didn't know I needed that in my life, but I did.  The porters are helpful in all ways, and speak fluent English. Just be sure, when checking out, to give some time for them to retrieve your car from parking. It took a good 20 minutes for them to bring it down, which had us"

Truly an experience of old- world luxury with the most courteous and helpful staff I have encountered in my travels.    The building itself is significant to the history of Mexico City, and the hotel has been maintained to honor that history.  And everyone - from the bellboys to the front desk staff to the restaurant staff - is friendly, professional, and kind.  (I was traveling solo, stayed for only 4 nights, and at least 3 or 4 staff members greeted me by name by day 2.)  My stay included breakfast, and the Terraza is amazing.  It overlooks the Zocalo, and the food is top notch.  I’ve been told by my tour guides that locals frequently come here as well for a special meal.

Upon arrival a bellman carries your bags up to reception, then serves you champagne as you check in.  Everyone is helpful.  When we called to get anything taken care of, extra towels, help with the safe, they arrive promptly and courteously.  Beautiful architecture, Tiffany glass ceiling, art deco.  The location is next to Zocalo square.  Convienant to many sights and restaurants.  They also have a roof top restuarant, service was lovely.  True old fashion customer service."

The staff were very attentive at your every needs. In particular Alejandro was great. He attended to our anniversary dinner which made it very special. Alejandro also took photos of our which captured the moment just perfect. Being in Mexico we were not sure on our wine selection, we asked his recommendation and it turned out to be an excellent choice. Alejandro is the best. We highly recommend the hotel and restaurant."

A luxurious hotel at a most reasonable price.  The staff were kind, courteous and helpful.  The hotel located on historic Zacola  Square is not only well situated, it offers an excellent panoramic view of the square.  The morning breakfast is voluminous with endless options.

It has a luxurious interior and is replete with old world features including an antique elevator as part of the decor.  The stained glass ceiling is famous.  The top floor with a further spiral stairway takes you to the Restaurant - the La Terraza - it includes an open terrace that looks directly down upon the City Zocalo.  All staff throughout the Hotel are very customer focused, always smiling and at your service.  It is well justified to leave a 100 peso gratuity on your bed each morning for the room attendants and a gratuity (or propina) of 10-15-20% for each restaurant meal's bill (la cuenta) is well received.

Great location and felt very safe. Rooms are lovely and even room 207 which was only a double was pretty big. My only gripe, you need to provide better quality and a bigger quantity of toiletries.

So try the giant margaritas there! Food really delicious too. We did several day trips. When the one organised by the hotel wasn’t very good (city tour) the hotel couldn’t have been more apologetic, reimbursing from the tour operator and being so very helpful in all respects. The concierge is amazing here. And it’s such a thrill to know Spectre was filmed here. I much prefer this part of town too with its history and grandeur. The best hotel experience - Thank you!

The hotel staff and the facility were amazing.  The room was clean and comfortable.  Our only issue came with the restaurant upstairs.  The menu wasn't great and the service was pretty poor at times.  At one dinner, we were repeatedly ignored by wait staff.  I had to get up and get my wife a napkin and silverware, even after requesting it.  When we finally were served, our dinners were cold and my steak was nearly raw.  I couldn't eat it.  They did take the steak off the bill, however, and the waiter gave us a piece of cake and apologized for the poor service.  Overall, I would stay there, but look for other places to eat."

The rooms are big and perhaps a tad old fashioned in their furnishing but comfortable and spotlessly clean and everything works. You’re slap bang in the centre of el centro and as a tourist there’s no better place to stay. The restaurant La Terraza looks out over the Zocalo. The food is great and the views superb. Note that as a guest you do not need to reserve more than a few hours in advance - they keep tables for huéspedes. The team is professional and nothing is too much trouble. This really is a classy operation. In London or New York it would be five times the price. It’s a great choice. I can’t imagine staying anywhere else in CDMX."

Our room was perfectly comfortable and quiet. The location was right on the Zocalo in the historical center. We had drinks nearly every night at the terrace restaurant with an amazing view of the square. I read some comments that the area didn't feel safe at night. While it is true that it's deserted compared to daytime, we never felt unsafe. And the main pedestrianized street next to the hotel had plenty of people.

This winding staircase might as well have been Mt Everest for my 91 year old father.   He would never make that climb.   My father uses a walker or wheelchair.   It states on the website there are 2 restaurants.  The other restaurant was on the main floor and was closed.   My father could’ve used this restaurant if it was open.

Staff is extremely helpful and friendly, providing top level service. The room was a master suit which the family and I enjoyed immensely. The Terraza roof top restaurant was a great place for lunch and dinner over looking the Zocalo. Staying in the historic center provides a great opportunity to explore the surroundings. The area is extremely safe and well policed. For the best tacos in the area go to los cocuyos about 5 blocks away. We highly recommend staying at The Gran Hotel and plan to return in the near future.

The staff was amazing the property is immaculate and right in the city center.  There is so much to do right outside the door, but I highly recommend coordinating transportation with the hotel.  We were given Christian and Jose Manuel who were awesome and took use all over the city to all the touristy hot spots.  Traffic is crazy so it was nice to have someone that knew where to go and its very affordable.  We cannot wait to get back!!"

From the moment I arrived, I felt welcomed and at home, thanks to the outstanding service provided by the hotel staff.  The rooms were spacious and immaculately clean, with all the amenities one would expect from a luxury hotel. The bed was comfortable, and the linens were soft and cozy, making it easy for me to relax and get a good night's sleep after a long day of sightseeing.  The food at the hotel's restaurant was exceptional. The chefs clearly take great pride in their work, as each dish was beautifully presented and bursting with flavour.

Our room had a view of the street. The room was spacious and everything you'd expect from a 5-star hotel. The Terraza Restaurant was beautiful with a view of the Zocalo. Food was delicious and has the omelet area. Bed was very comfortable. Service was immaculate. Staff were friendly and oh so helpful.

A very lovely concierge booked us into breakfast and took us up to the room in the old ‘30s style elevator. She also gave us a bit of history about the amazing stained glass roof in the main atrium. When we got to our breakfast table, we had a great view of the Plaza de la Constitucion and  Catedral Metropolitan at Zocalo. The service provided by David Coronado was fantastic. The staff couldn’t do enough for us and the food was excellent. Thoroughly recommend having breakfast here even if you’re not staying in the hotel. Great start to a day in Mexico City."

We went intending to enjoy the glass, and probably get dinner as well at 6pm. The lobby had a very strange layout, I must say, and had a non-welcoming vibe and design overall. They had a worker repairing some ramp elevator at the entrance with a metal grinder making an incredible cacophany for over 20 minutes...a strange choice of timing as people were arriving for dinner. The restaurant was difficult to locate, and when I asked to see a menu, I was referred to one of those obnoxious scannable menu links - not something I'd expect at an upscale place.   The lobby was very sparsely decorated, was overly bright, and seems that nobody with interior design sense was"

The location is amazing and the breakfast buffet is fantastic for the view over the square and the choice of food. The green juices were amazing! The staff were friendly and helpful, the room was comfortable and large, we loved the old colonial feel of the hotel. The one negative - there was a constant fan noise (we think) we could hear from the room (note its not double glazed) so be aware if you book a room with two double beds on the third floor. This was the only noise we heard and ear plugs helped.  For the location you are only 20mins from the airport and as Mexico City is a very big city with lots of traffic  this was another plus.  Overall a great stay in an amazing hotel, recommended."
