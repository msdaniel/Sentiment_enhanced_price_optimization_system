The room was hot even with the AC at the lowest setting, so it took a while before I could get cool and comfortable. That’s the only reason I didn’t give 5 stars.

All were nice, clean, and spacious (on the fourth floor) except room 605.  The setup was a little cramped, but the bathroom was the real issue.  It was a lot smaller compare to the others, water was leaking, and they had mold/mildew.  Not sure if it’s bc it’s an older room...    We had the lunch buffet and the food was surprisingly good.  I think it was about $15/person but had fresh seafood, jumbo shrimp, scallops, crabs, fish, tacos, paella, ...a lot of good food.  It was convenient for us to grab breakfast and coffee in the morning before we start our day.   Location was really convenient.  We walked around at night to eat dinner and felt safe.  It took about 10 min to Uber to Roma.    Everyone at the front desk and doorman were super friendly and"

Dingy check in. Desk agents friendly with limited English. Rooms with chipping paint 🎨 and bathrooms 🚽 that have a sewage back up odor. Oh the view is of the wall of building next door that’s 15 feet away. Breakfast 🥞 place was hopping as if the locals use it too and was tasty 😋. Over all an “average” experience and thus 3-stars."

There are restaurants and cafes around. The place itself is a bit ran down. We had a split visit and got two different rooms in the new building behind the classical one, shown on photos. The rooms were very small, with not a lot of free space to move, but the bed was comfortable. My main problem was the bathroom, not the one you expect from 4 stars hotel. It was outdated with the shower head, that couldn't be moved. In the first room it was sprinkling out the water in all directions.  The service and the reception was very professional and friendly."

The bed is tiny, the room is small with just one bed stand and much room for you close. 6 nights in that room feels a bit cramped. The room was quiet, clean with good wifi. The restaurant is surprisingly good and cheap, we ate there 2 nights. In the morning it is very busy and even though our breakfast was included we were still told to sign (more or less slapped with) a bill for the breakfast with not much of an explanation, as our spanish is limited. Otherwise the service in the restaurant was busy, but kind. The breakfast is good, diversified and tasty, but the salsas was HOT - be careful. The guys in the reception are nice and helpful.

After spending our first night in our rather smallish room, we requested an upgrade to a larger unit. For a modest upcharge we were put into a junior suite which was much more suitable for us.  The entire staff was friendly and most helpful, in particular these three on the front desk: Mario Chong, Luis Garcia and Gustavo Viveros. Thank You Gentlemen! We had breakfast each morning in either the Coffee Shop or the restaurant up one floor. Both were very good and willing to do any special requests we had. Four members of the restaurant staff were particularly helpful. Mario, the Maitre D', and waiters Martin, Ismael and Fernando who is multilingual.

We stayed at the Emporio Reforma last year for a week and enjoyed our stay thoroughly. The staff are friendly and accommodating; the rooms are good value for the money; the location is excellent. I particularly want to note the breakfast buffet...it is the best anywhere in the world, and includes both Mexican and international dishes. AND..home-made preserves in different flavors, some of which I'd never tried before. There is a taxi rank just outside the back entrance to the hotel, so people who are cautious about taxis in Mexico City (that includes me) can make good use of the service. One last point. This is a hotel with genuine Mexican ambiance. Most of the guests seem to be people from the provinces rather than"

Students had to transfer 50% of the cost of their rooms by a deadline. The transfers added app. $ 100.00 to their accommodation costs because both the bank in Ecuador and the bank in Mexico charged a fee for the transaction. In the XXI century, it is utterly unacceptable to offer a single payment method; credit cards, debit cards and Paypal should always remain an option. 2.

The only thing I have to say is about room key... I had to replace it many times as it demagnetized so often...  Cafeteria is a very nice place for a really good coffee and great patisserie"

Now I want to say  this year the front desk staff has been incredible especially Julianna villamar. She knew our names after the first day and helped us plan our day with food recommendations and travel directions. She was interested to hear about our day the next morning.Having smiling,helpful front desk staff makes a big difference in your stay. Congratulations emporio reforma you did great with your new hires. At first we were reluctant to return to this hotel although we like the location , now we will definitely return."

The hotel is fine, its the service that I'm disappointed with. From the almost $20 resort (or whatever it is) tax to help hops insisting they come up to my room and try to take my luggage (I only have a small bag and prefer to take my own) for 'a tip' to repeated requests to have the mini-bar emptied out as I wouldn't use it and wanted to put other drinks in it and being refused to asking where a tour bus pick up point was and shoveled into one of their cabs and 200  Pecos can fare later when it was 2 bl9cks to the left.  I've off-site for the week so am stuck but think ill stay at the Holiday Inn next time."
