Excellent location just off the Ave Paseo de la Reforma in the Zona Rosa and just around the corner from El Angel de la Independencia.  Neighborhood is very safe.

I wanted to sleep in and certainly could not do that. Also I kept getting random calls early in AM and I'd pick up and it would just go straight to a ringer, SMH. Bathroom ceiling is peeling a lot.   PROS: Excellent location. 24/7 room service and wifi is GREAT.   If I could have slept without noise, I would have enjoyed my stay more. You should really warn your guests about any days you're doing construction or find a way to acommodate."

The hotel is at a very good location on an inside road very close to Paseo de la Reforma. For most part the experience of staying there was extremely positive and the staff was reasonably friendly and responsive to my needs. The food at the restaurant was extremely good and I was super impressed by its flavor profile and taste. The one thing that these people have to work on actually is their facilities. The plumbing is in very poor condition. I had drains blocked, WCs malfunctioning and poor water flow. The air-conditioning is loud and needs an obvious refurbishment as well. That needs to be fixed for me to come back.  Everything else about the place is very nice. Especially the most helpful"

The hotel is in a very convenient place there’s food & shops around but it’s about 30 mins from the center of CDMX without traffic. We booked thru our job for a double bed standard room and we’re told we had to pay extra at the front desk for two beds which was extremely aggravating. We were celebrating a birthday no acknowledgment of that either unlike other hotels we been too. There was a huge party on Saturday and the walls were so thin we didn’t get any sleep it felt like we were at the party."
