Hands-down fabulous in every respect. From the initial communication with Alex via email, and then her welcoming us to the hotel. Everything was perfect. Every  member of staff  was welcoming and helpful. We were there to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary and hotel celebrated with us with lovely decorations in our bedroom. The breakfast was delicious, and the walking tour was phenomenal. I could go on as every aspect was A++. Do yourself a favor and just book Hotel Histórico."

This is the place to stay.  Everything about our stay was excellent.  The service at the front desk was top notch.  Rebeca and Alex were two names I remember for sure.  The service at the on-site cafe was great, and the selection was very nice.  The breakfast service was also great, and the food was very good.  The team helped us arrange a tour to the Teotihuacan Pyramids and the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe.    The team arranged for a car service to pick us up from the airport, and to take us back.  The location of the hotel is perfect, walking distance to so many attractions and restaurants.  I give this hotel a 5 out of 5.   Thanks to the entire team for making our vacation so"

Breakfast and 24/7 sandwiches, coffee, and beer included was a real highlight. Special shout-out to Luis, Gonzalo, Arturo, Ancleves, & Alexander for preparing a delicious Mexican breakfast for us each morning. The room was clean, king sized bed was spacious and comfortable, and room service was incredibly attentive! The only thing worth mentioning that could have been better was our small room size and lack of an outward facing window (the window included just opened up to a sort of skylight). But for the price we paid and given we were out and about touring CDMX for most of our time at the hotel, this wasn’t a huge issue. Great location for meeting our tour group near the Palacio de Bellas Artes in"

Rooms were small but had everything we needed and were very clean. Housekeeping were great and serviced the room daily. Breakfast was great. It was order off the menu. Could get quite busy. So we tried to avoid it at peak times. The free Cafe was fantastic and available 24 hours I beleive. We had it even for our dinner one night when we were tired and didn't feel like going out.

The included breakfast and cafe are very convenient for fueling up before a day of exploring the city.  We were glad to have booked Teotihuacan through the hotel. It was convenient, and we learned a lot from our knowledgeable guide. The entire hotel staff was wonderful, always greeting us with a smile and making us feel so very welcome. We are especially grateful for Didier and Antenea's assistance. If it weren't for their help, we wouldn't have been able to get into Frida Kahlo's house on our last day in CDMX. Wonderful hotel with an excellent staff!!!"

The hotel will apply an inflated higher exchange rate to convert your bill into pesos and then overcharge upon check out. They'll also run you through some hoops if you ask for that money back. They will say this is just their normal policy but IMO it effectively did not honor the discounted rate I had agreed to on booking, at least not until after frustrating hoops I should not have had to go through.  I booked through Hotels.com. On booking, I was quoted in USD and offered a choice of paying right away through Hotels.com or paying later at the hotel. I chose to pay later. This was a mistake, as had I paid through"

We walked from here to many of the main places to see in Mexico City and always felt very safe. 2) Cleaniness - excellent. 3) Room - although small, very comfortable, good bed, good shower. 4) Food - being Vegans this is always a challenge. Roberto our waiter helped sort out breakfast for us (thank you!)  - fruit (of course) and tortillas with veg and re-fried beans and without the cheese, which was very nice.  Non-dairy milk was available too. On the morning that Roberto was not there, our new waiter did not know what to do and got the chef to see us, who then managed to do the same as the previous two mornings. 5) Cafe - brilliant to have a cafe for no extra cost.  There was one vegetarian option"

The lobby was attractive and my room was spacious and comfortable. The staff and extra amenities were what made the stay memorable. The waiters in the restaurant were efficient and attentive. The doormen, especially Ulysses, helped me to feel safe and taken care of as we climbed into our cab. The concierge staff stood out and, as I tell everyone who asks about my trip, provided the best quality of service that I have experienced in all my travels. Alexandra was friendly, spoke perfect English and provided we two women traveling alone with terrific information and service. In addition, there’s a cafe that’s open 24/7 and offers complimentary non-alcohol drinks and snacks. Coming back to this hotel at the end of a day exploring the"

I traveled with a friend/neighbor and we each had separate rooms.  The rooms were spacious, updated, and immaculate.  I am a light sleeper and was grateful that my room was quiet and that there was a central fan I could turn on as “white noise” at night.   There was a large staff available 24/7 and all were friendly and helpful.  The concierge, Alex (Alejandro Audelo), was knowledgeable, experienced, and eager to assist.  She spoke impeccable English and made our overall experience highly memorable.   As two single women we were cautious about safety, but felt completely at ease both in the hotel and the surrounding district, the  Historical Centro.  It was within walking distance to many interesting and beautiful"

It has more than ample staff to accommodate anything you might need. The free breakfast is served by a wonderful wait staff, not a pre-packaged buffet. From 7 a.m. until 11 p.m. the concierge desk is staffed by a knowledgeable soul who can tell you where to go (and not go) in the Mexico City area. Also available are a full set of tours that pick you up at the door. There are bottled water refrigerators on every floor. And perhaps best of all, the 24-hour cafe serves complimentary meals and snacks to all guests. If we are ever in Mexico City again, we will be staying here.   One minor note, the balcony rooms face a fairly busy street and can be a little noisy. Get a high floor or inside room to avoid that."
