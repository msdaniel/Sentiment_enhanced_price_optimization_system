Always  a great time when we visit the Sunrise pool. Pablo takes great care of us.  Other people that took great care of us were Richard and his fabulous crew. Ricky, Anell and Ruben the bartender. Wilbert at Gold course bar. David at LaTratoria. Abraham at sunrise bar. Felipe at the Grand bar was outstanding. McGiver at the Library always takes great care of us. Jeremiah the golf cart driver was awesome"

Rooms were nice, not sure why the hot tub in the center of the room with two doubles beds is a good design idea but I don’t do design. Limited to none NA beer options….something that should change based on time…"

Abrham is very knowledgeable about the menu and he makes the whole  dining experience so much  fun. Riviera Maya, see if I can remember  all the names that need to be recognized, Carlos, Wendy, Jorge, Araceli, and especially  Alan Ernesto, for such a young man, Ernesto was very knowledgeable about the Mayan culture and food."

We went with our family and friends and before I give my review, I will say that my children had fun, but I’ve stayed in a lot of all inclusive resorts and this one was by far the worst.  I would NEVER recommend this property to anyone for the following reasons:  ROOMS: - rooms were filthy.  I’m talking dried toothpaste on the bathroom mirror, dirty dingy linens, dirt in every corner… yuck!  - rooms were TINY and very poorly designed.   There’s a giant tub in the middle of the room and the AC is pointing towards it instead of pointing towards the beds!  - our air conditioner didn’t work one full day (it was stifling hot in the room and we had to leave immediately because we were concerned about the health of our children).

We traveled with our family of four, and a family of friends who also had four. Our room was part of the Nizuc location.  Everywhere we went, between Nizuc and Sunrise, was within walking distance, but there were always golf cart shuttles ready and willing to give rides.  The rooms as well as the grounds are clean, well kept, and lovely.  It was very quiet and serene near all the rooms.  We enjoyed both pools and always were able to find space for our whole crew.  We participated and enjoyed the activities at the pool and played beach volleyball.  The people who work at this resort are incredibly friendly, kind, fun, and share comradery with their fellow workers.  We'd like to recognize a couple specifically:  Rodrigo was our"

Jesús Alejandro and Martha at the Góndola restaurant were extraordinary with their service. We mentioned that we liked spice with our foods and they let us know that the Gondola restaurant only had tabasco to offer for chiles. They then went out of their way to go to another restaurant at the hotel to get us spicy sauce/chile so we could enjoy our meals.  The staff always had good conversations with us and were always very helpful. 10/10 recommend this hotel for family, friend, or couple vacations."

It is a beautiful hotel with many beautiful amenities and great staff but we are “into” smaller hotels.  Was dismayed at lack of chairs at the beach as we are not pool people we love the ocean. Food was fantastic but was shocked one night when private parties booked up half restaurants for dinner, no buffet open and 2-3 hour waits for dinner at the 3 restaurants left. Elite Transfer to hotel left us stranded and had to hire a cab and pay again with no refund on transfer we paid for."

We had what I felt was a minor issue that Public Relations worked helped me through. Beach photos online are photoshopped and very misleading. No part of their entire beach is blue or clear at all. It is a protected beach so they cannot clean all seaweed and I fully respect and understand that, even appreciate it honestly. I will note that the resort itself is beautiful, their staff are amazing and the food was top notch! Their restaurant options are truly 4-5 star restaurants, all inclusive! Overall my family very much enjoyed the resort and I am certain I only saw 10% of it, the place is absolutely massive compared any other standard all inclusive resort in Cancun."

As other reviewers have mentioned, the first “meeting” you have when you walk in is a sales pitch. “Come visit The Grand where we will give you a tour of the grounds and you can enjoy breakfast. The total time should be around an hour and a half. You will get a $500 resort credit and 2 day passes to come back to the Grand to enjoy our amenities. This is only if everyone in your party attends.” Even though the Grand is a part of Moon Palace, guests are not able to enjoy any of the restaurants, amenities, etc unless you sit for hours at their sales pitch or pay $100 per person, per day. SCAM!"

For a place you can go for under 2 grand a person I don't know what else you could want.  This was our second trip to the resort and it probably won't be our last.  We went in july so the heat was oppressive, but luckily there's  lots of water.  The nice part about that was the resort was probably only at about 50% capacity.  There was no waiting for anything.  You want to take out a kayak or sailboat, go to whatever restaurant you want, or get a good seat for a show - was always easy.  The service was great whether you tipped or not.  Some resorts you can definitely tell that service is better for good tippers.  Here it is not.  consistently good all the time.    In the past there was a seaweed issue on the beach.  They"

The customer service  here is horrible at Sunrise! We been here since 1:00pm and been have going back and fourth with guest services and main lobby.

We had a couple of day passes to the The Grand but felt it was so much busier there. We checked out a few of their pools and found that they were really crowded. The Sunrise (which you could go to anytime without a day pass) and the Nizuc were great! Lots of pools and lots of space/chairs to relax on by the pools.

A suggestion, if you're wanting to get into any restaurants that don't take reservations, get there when they open if you have a bigger party.  Pros: 1. Amazing food/staff especially at Gondola: Antonio Callesas, Alejandro, and Lizbeth.  2. The 24 hour cafe that had incredible desserts-delicious. 3. The man who pushed around the ice cream cart by the pool. We loved him! 4. Lots of activities for kids and adults both during the day and in the evening. 5. Steakhouse at Nizuc-a must do just get there when they open because they don't take reservations. 6. Pepe's wood fired pizzas!!!! YUMMMMMMMM.  Cons: 1.

Our daughter turned 4 the day after we arrived and while we have always felt the staff was amazing, they truly went above and beyond for her that day. We took her to the Playroom at Sunrise to play and the staff there gave her little gifts and trinkets for her to take home, including a Barbie- totally unexpected. Needless to say, she was over the moon. The housekeeping staff was great as well and always restocked little snacks and drinks for us multiple times throughout the day. We love Moon Palace so much that we're visiting again in August of this year. Can't wait to be back!"

Adan was really knowledgeable and taught us a good amount in a 2.5 hour period.  Now we feel more confident with our swing and body alignment.  I highly recommend Adan he is the best instructor!"
