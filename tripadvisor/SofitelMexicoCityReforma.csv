The Club Millésime team (Santiago, Gina, Sofía, Laura, Luis, Natalia and Citlali, and others whom I cannot recall because there are so many),  made each day special by always greeting me with a smile.  Also Martha, Jose Delgado, José Manuel and Jany are fantastic stewards of hospitality!  They always made sure my requests and needs were met each day.  Each and every employee of this hotel exemplifies superior customer service unlike any other hotel I have ever experienced. I recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Mexico City!!"

They even had a decorating kit for the stroller for our baby. I also happened to badly sprain my foot right before we landed in Mexico, and they were prepared and ready with a wheelchair, ice, and everything I needed. Rico, Fatima, and Raul were amazing at Restaurant Balta and they even brought out cake for breakfast with a candle for my daughter.

After going through the labyrinth of Benito Juarez Airport, Sofitel had Cesar Ayala waiting for us with a big sign. He got us right away into a comfy suburban and navigated us out of the airport and rapidly through sleepy CDMX then safely to the hotel.
