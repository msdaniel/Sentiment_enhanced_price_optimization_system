Beach was great but having to pay for beach and pool beds is not necessary; there were many not used because of this.  Rooms were very nice and large and the ac worked great."

As soon as we arrived, we were greeted with smiles, champagne, and cool towels. The staff was all so warm and helpful during the entire stay. To my surprise, food and drinks were great. The resort itself was very nice and clean. There were enough activities that we didn’t even need to leave the resort to have fun! My friends and I (all late 20s-mid 30s) are already planning our trip next year. 10/10 recommend!"

We had a swim up suite which was worth the extra expense. It was not crowded at all, we never had to wait for anything and would definitely return. Service was excellent and the staff was very friendly. We did have one staff member who was trying to get us to attend a Hyatt promotion in exchange for coupons/voucher, and we didn't like that. It is a laid back resort, so if you're looking for a party, this isn't your place. But we loved it."

Hands down the best vacation everrrr!! The entire staff was extremely attentive and the food is to die for not to say all the awesome activities from aqua cycling, Salas lessons, art painting with an ocean view and the most important of all they would make me pozole and chicken mole and deliver it to my room. Every night there was a show very entertaining. The Micheal Jackson show was pretty awesome.   ABEL at the Spice was so welcoming and friendly we became friends he made all my meals happen even if they were not on the menu. I got to meet the chef and personally thank him for my first class meals  Oh and not to brag even more it’s the most outstanding clean environment ever. Seriously I was in paradise.

The whole place needs a complete re-vamp. This is not a 5 star resort and the service is completely lacking. We split our week stay between 2 resorts and unfortunately, the first one was way better all around, making this even more disappointing. Let's get into it.  We arrived early, around 1:30pm fully expecting that our room wouldn't be ready. We are Hyatt members and booked a swim up suite. We did not receive a towel, or a drink, or any of the perks that others were receiving. No big deal. Our room was clean, but not ready for check-in. We needed something from our bags and they had tagged the wrong luggage and were in complete panic mode trying to figure out where it went. Finally, around 4, a staff member from"

We ere quickly whisked away to our suites and while our kids got a regulars suite, I splurged a little and got the swim up….which, I would highly recommend.  Memorable staff include Jorgina, Jesus, Abimayel, Martin, Nina and Janett. They all made our experience truly amazing!!  Our favorite restaurant turned out to be Punta Vista although we tried all of them out. Great views and atmosphere with some amazing quality seafood and steaks!!  The flank steak at Maria Maria was a hit as well.  The cafe in the morning was a must stop and all of the workers there went above and beyond.  A no brainer in my mind and I"

The spa experience (that came with the room upgrade) was surprising. It was great. Eddie at the spa - top notch.  The beach cabanas were also wonderful. Never thought I'd enjoy a cabana as I did. Very comfortable and relaxing and enjoyed the breeze and sun protection.  Maybe i better give it one more star, from 3 to 4.  Definitely not a 5 star....but better than a 3 star."

Friendly staff 2. Beautiful resort 3. Quality food 4. All the rooms appear to have some variation of ocean view so that is nice 5. Cafe is one of these best we have been to  The cons 1. Another hotel with staff trying to lure you in with coupons and discounts to listen in on a 1 hour session of timeshare 2. Restaurant choices are limited compared to others at this price point. I don't think bars and Cafés should count as restaurants 3. We booked 7 rooms, one of them was located on the far end of the resort [room 123] and looked nothing like what we booked. It was dim with little lighting and much smaller rolm around the bed area. When we inquired, staff said no other rooms available which is probably just BS and laziness. 4. Annoyances such as, faulty jacuzzi,"

I love Hyatt’s as is and was happy to come for a retreat to this location. The property itself is gorgeous, walking around to and from your room feels luxurious. The beds were more than comfortable, I didn’t want to leave! Lots of food options for all foodies and on top of any dietary concerns if there are any. Entertainment on property was delightful, loved the shows that were held in the atrium/lobby area. Shout out to all chefs and staff! Everyone was so warm and friendly. Favorite part of having mango and blueberry ice cream for breakfast 😂 Big shout out to Rob and Luis Alfonso being so awesome and making my trip fun and memorable!!

Everything was perfect from service, dining, activities, cleanliness, cocktails, etc. There is so much to do and even though we stayed 6 days, it was not enough time to experience half of what was available. I would love to extend my gratitude and thank a few people that we got to know. - Sergio at the beach. He was quick, efficient, kind and his service was exceptional! we visited him at least 3 times while we were there. He is awesome!! - Jorge at Spice buffet. We first got to know him on Mexican Fiesta night in the center area, he was SO FUN to be around. He sings and dances and provides excellent service. We saw him a few times after that at Spice buffet (he's more late lunch and dinner shift) and kept running into him now and then."

Everything advertised met the expectations to a T. I would recommend this place if anyone is looking for an adults-only all-inclusive beach vacation. The hotel made everything completely perfect.

Pros Very secure and safe.  Staff goes above and beyond to make sure you have the best vacation possible. Shout out to Daniel- waiter at Spice and all of the staff in the cafe. They morning shift made sure to send us a bag of treats for the wait at airport.  Facility very clean. Food amazing. Not over crowded-can always find a private place to enjoy. Pools/hot tubs will not burn your eyes w chlorine.   Cons-  very few and minimal. Not enough to change our opinion that this is the place to stay.  Hot tub in room takes very long time to fill. 30 min plus. Snacks in room always pringles and nuts. Would have been nice to have had something sweet.

The service in all the areas was excellent, from the restaurants to the coffee shop to the spa. We reserved a cabana on Sunday and Abimeal took excellent care of us all day, making sure we had drinks, water, and food. We got the Mayan massages at  the spa  with Patricia and Cynthia; best massage I’ve ever had! Rosy at the spa (Zen water journey) was also great.  The food was surprisingly good for an all-inclusive; Asiana was my favorite for dinner and Punta Vista by the pool was cool for lunch.   Spice had an excellent selection for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and I don’t typically like buffets at all.  Drinks were pretty good, especially at Punta Vista and the Den.

The smallest rooms seem large, with in-suite hot tubs. The service is immediate and courteous. The drinks are good, and made better if you request a specific spirit (Eg. a Margarita with Don Julio). The activities are frequent and diverse. We enjoyed Yoga with Diana, hat painting and abrije painting, pool parties on Tuesday and Friday, and nightly live entertainment. The dining experience was also phenomenal, with Alexander putting on an excellent show at Asiana Tepanyaki. Additionally, the cocktail class at the Den was a highlight of the trip.

Great food, especially at Spice restaurant. Highly recommend the Wahoo local fish!!  The spa was to die for- best 80 minute massage and hydrotherapy experience is free if you arrive 60 minutes before your appointment. What they don’t tell you is that you can enjoy the spa the day AFTER your appt for the hydrotherapy experience a second time for FREE.  Cons:  We didn’t love having to pay for a cabana but we did and you should ($70/day) however, they play club party music on the north side of the pool all.day.long.

The beach and ocean were so beautiful, it was like something out of a movie. The beach is soft, yellow sand and the ocean a clear beautiful blue. The waves were gentle and the water perfect to just walk right in. I'm not sure if it was the time of year I visited (early June) or normal, but it wasn't crowded. There was also a free gazebo or lounge chair to relax on as well.  I didn't really spend much time awake in my room. It was nice, but I spent my time in the beach, pools and with friends or family.

They don’t have umbrellas around the pool area and you don’t have any shade whatsoever. The only shade you will get is if you purchased a Bali bed for just say 70$ a day. Not good but I must have shade so we paid for it. A lot of people aren’t prepared for that extra cost. That would be the only reason keeping me from coming back.  2. The resort is nice rooms are nice and large and the AC works well.  3. The food has been very good and I’m a foodie so I love good food. The selections of food was great   4.

This is by far the best hotel/resort experience I had in the Cancun area.  What did it make it so special? The people who work there! All the staff are AMAZING; from the front-desk clerks, to the servers, bartenders, entertainment and fitness staff, everyone we encounter delivered top-notch service. No matter what you need, they are there to help. I felt welcomed at all times.  THE LOCATION  Located at the popular Hotel Zone, access was easy from the airport. We used a private transportation company and booked ahead, but it is also possible to take a taxi (less than 20 min ride).  All the rooms are facing the ocean. The views are incredible! Turquoise waters and clear sands. I loved my morning walks on the beach!  THE FOOD  There are a few restaurants at the hotel, as well"

Eloisa and Adrian great at the beach. Punta Vista host and waiters 5 stars. Only 2 stars for Buffet and Asian restaurant food. Too many cabanas, therefore not enough lounge chairs and umbrellas. Too much sales pressure at check in, for massage and other offers. Felt like exit at the airport. Amazing e-concierge service. Monica Zarate.

I spent a total of 8 days at this resort and half of those I was out the entire day.   The 4 days I did spend at the resort I mostly just hung out on my balcony (which was FANTASTIC) reading. I didn't do any resort activities, I didn't listen to any of the evening entertainment, etc. I did eat at the restaurants, which were all very very good.

All Real club members are treated as average resort guests. They no longer have a Real member concierge on site. Pressing folks into switching to Hyatt program. Resort is average at best.

I used USA Transfers for this and they were very professional and easy to use. The resort welcomed us in their beautiful lobby (if you have seen the movie Barb and Star Go To Vista Del Mar this is where it was filmed).  I love to workout so we went to the gym daily. It has cardio equipment, free weights and machines, a pilates studio, an outdoor lap pool and lounging area, as well as kettlebells and steps.

Do yourself a favor and reserve the cabana you want (marked “for rent”) at least one day during your stay.  There are plenty open on the beach as well.

Hyatt Zilara Cancun gave me the experience I never knew I was missing.   The location was perfect, just 25 minutes or less from the airport, so we were there in no time.  This is an oceanfront resort with ALL rooms having a view of the ocean (no upcharge).   PROs: The Service—by far the best service I have ever received abroad or even in the U.S. The SERVICE is what separates this resort from all other resorts.  From the bell boy to the maintenance crew, if they saw you at anytime of the day, they would put their hand over their heart, smile and greet you.  They made you feel welcomed and as if you were family.  NEVER in the entire week did this not happen at any place I step my foot in."

Luis was a great server on the beach, always checking to make sure we had lots of water and never had an empty hand.   The pool was way to warm , more like a bath tub.
