The staff is very supportive no matter what silly thing we need.  This time it was shredding extra paperwork - note there is a shredder in the business center.    The food in the main restaurant is tasty.  I particularly liked the short rib tacos, but be warned, they are juicy so be prepared to make a mess.    The rooms are large, the closets ample, the how water in the shower is relaxing.    Overall a great property."

Also, and forgive me as we can't remember her name, there was a kind and caring cleaner that was working the restrooms on the 2nd floor that was beyond wonderful. The only critique we have was a major one; the room heater would not stay on to match the temperature and would turn off after a few minutes - my wife and I both got sick because of it. In the restrooms there are automatic lights that turn on when you pass a sensor, with no ability to turn off the apparatus. Needless to say, when you have to go the restroom in the middle of the night, you get blinded yourself plus your partner wakes up"

The service was excellent and the room very comfortable - this time on the 17th floor!  The lobby restaurant offers a tasty breakfast with an omelette bar.  It's also a great place to meet colleagues at the end of the day for drinks.  I look forward to returning on my next trip to Mexico City!"

Unfortunately our final cost was 80% higher than the quoted room rate. Part of the difference was local taxes, but they charge you exorbitant amounts for anything extra. For example, the 1L bottled water in your room is $7.50 if you drink it, and we were afraid to drink the tap water in Mexico. Buyer beware."

However, let's start with the positives: great location, good rooms, decent wifi speed.  On the not so positive side I will start with the most noticeable one: staff is truly unhelplful and int some cases bordering rude. This hotel really needs to work on training their staff, they seem to be unhappy about their jobs and avoid interacting with guests (with some exceptions).  Also on the improvement list is the qualify of the food served: it´s mediocre, mostly  breakfast at Rulfo,  however, they´re not shy about charging a fortune for it.  I also found their lifts to be funny, they have at least 8 of them, however, at times only 1 seems to be going up or down as it stops in every other floor.   Fortunately, there are other"

Let me start with the breakfast, you can probably get all kind of food either by picking it up at the counter or by ordering it at the counter. You can serv you self juice, water , yogurt and all kind of food, but not the coffee! No the coffee you have to ask some of the very busy waiters who is literally running between the tables to clean up, put clean cutlery and serving coffee. If they don’t’ carry the coffee pot, they have to run (literally again) to pick up one and then on the way to you pour coffee to the folks on the way, and some times there will be enough coffee left for you.

Plenty of other ""nice"" hotels in Mexico City to stay at, that have better service than the Hyatt Regency. Booked through Amex as part of The Hotel Collection - but didn't really get any upgrades either. So I would recommend booking a different hotel through Amex Travel that will actually give you the complimentary upgrades."

Great Japanese restaurant in the hotel & a good coffee shop too. All staff were very helpful. Housekeeping didn’t replenish water or tea bags without daily follow up."

All kinds of equipment and all very new. Looking forward to try the tennis courts there in my next trip to Mexico city"

We had to call down a manager to verify that they did have suites available and it was very embarrassing and a huge hassle for us to go through this. I don’t understand why this hotel doesn’t treat globalist better. I hope the manager, relations manager or GM is reading this review and they can reach out to us directly to verify. Brandon/Brooke zandt stay: 4/19-4/21 . we shouldn’t have to fight the front desk staff for our awarded upgrades. This is a direct Hyatt brand too which makes this incidence even more"
