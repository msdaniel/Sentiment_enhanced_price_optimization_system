The staff and so friendly and helpful. They make you feel amongst friends not strangers. The food at the buffet is really good. You here buffet and you don't think it'll be that great but it was really great with just enough options. The food in the Restaurants are a little limited and threw isn't much air conditioner there, but again the staff is great. Everything was clean and convenient. Alejandro and Jeu were just amazing. Making friends amongst strangers with them meant the world. The rooms are just stunning. One word to the wise do not leave your balcony door open or your room will immediately become a slip 'n slide even a small cracked door. Oversll for me 10/10"

Overall If I was rating out of a 10 I would give this 9/10.  We had a big party of friends, so the only downfall it was harder to get us in the restaurants early enough to enjoy the experince- We felt rushed by the staff due to the time of 2 nights.  The last night at Tahini was the absolute best customer service, they were opening, friendly and took their time with our party.  I really appreciated that.  Vista Restaurant was another restaurant that was amazing for breakfast and lunch! Our room was so nice! Clean, the cleaning staff were amazing! We ended up getting the swim out, if you are looking for more privacy do  not get the swim out room.  We had a random neighbor come out,"

We were at the serenity and had an amazing experience.   The Mexican Buffet is outstanding! Some of the restaurants are also good, we liked the steak house and the Asian, the rest of the restaurants are average.   Drinks are OK, I kept drinking Mezcal and spicy Margarita. Michel** and Anotion's coctails are nice. But the guy at Mixology Bar (Main building) I think his name is Miguel he is the best!   We spent most or our time at the main pool just because of the activities. Pepe is a great fun, and there was another (petite) lady forgot her name but they had the best energy with fun activities.  If you have the time go to visit Isla Moujeres it's fun. I wouldn't take the tours from the hotel, I think online you can find much cheaper"

I highly, highly recommend this hotel if you’re looking for a place to relax in Cancun. It’s also only 15-20 minutes away from the airport which was great"

The service, Brandon gave us with laughter at the bar a tour of the serenity club, treating us to a special birthday dinner and giving tips on where to go in town, made this birthday one I will never forget. Michel and Raul joked and laughed with us at the poolside bars every day.

Look at the hotel website for specific requirements.** Pros: This was a very tropical and lovely property. It is well maintained and the staff is friendly and helpful. I particularly appreciated that upon arrival, we were given our arm bands/room keys (cool idea), and allowed to go get lunch before we had access to our rooms at 3pm. The rooms were clean and kept well-stocked.  We never had trouble getting into the restaurants for dinner, even without reservations (it is first-come-first served in most).

The night manager “Obed”, was less than friendly or helpful and very dismissive, as he would only communicate with my husband.

The hotel, staff, pool, everything was so great... honestly so good (I loved our room, the jucuzzi tub on the balcony, etc). But the food was VERY hit or miss. So, for being an all-inclusive, it knocked off some points for me. Room service, breakfast, and lunch often had some good items, some really bad items, but most were edible just not good. Dinner was better, but we only had opportunity to go to two places: Olios (delicious) and the Asian restaurant (if you like good sushi, probably not the place to go - fish is subpar, warm, etc. - it's apparently more popular for the teppanyaki - which we didn't do - some items were better than others here).

Hugo, the bartender at the pool bars, was great and always made our group amazing drinks! Enrique is a mixologist who was both entertaining and a master bartender. Yami had groups at the pool participating in sporting events and was both a fun  and expert Black Jack dealer!   The best restaurants were the Mexican steakhouse and Satsu (Asian cuisine). The food was incredible. You have to get governors tacos at the Mexican steakhouse - they are delicious. Everything at Satsu, from the sushi to the bowls, was awesome.   For breakfast and lunch we always ate at the buffet. We saw a few reviews on here with some complaints, but keep in mind it’s a buffet, so it caters to everyone. Every day"

Resort is extremely beautiful, well-organized, and very clean. There are two pools, one “party” pool and one “chill” pool, both of which are overall pretty chill - the “party” pool just has activities and a DJ. Pools and swim-up bars are outstanding, though the water could be a touch cooler. The activities are amazing. We did beach volleyball, water volleyball, blackjack, water cycling, water aerobics, and cornhole, all of which were awesome. Elias, Maui, Yami, and Pepe are the entertainment crew and were all amazing and made everyone’s experience so memorable. Restaurants were all very yummy with lots to choose from and we couldn’t ask for much more (we did not do any reservations). Night entertainment was exceptional. We loved all the shows. Casino"

We booked through a travel agent and were on a budget due to some gals in the group not being able to afford too much. I’m a hotel snob and frequent traveler for work and pleasure. I was super skeptical that I would like the place due to how affordable it was. I was pleasantly surprised.   The rooms were amazing!  We upgraded to the serenity club and it was well worth it. The view, private pool, discount at the spa and butler were all a great touch. Edith was our butler and she was the best butler I’ve ever had. Spoke great English, super responsive and helpful.  She was like a live Alexa who was at our beck and call anytime.   The spa was the most incredible I’ve seen and I’ve been to a ton of them. Highly recommend"

I stayed very recently in an oceanfront swim out room in building 1. Upon arrival, everything seemed nice, but as soon as I got to my room, I knew it was going to be a rough trip. Our air conditioning didn't work, and we had to have help twice to get it to cool down. It's over 100° this time of year, and it's needed. Our butler Charly was the absolute worst. I tipped him $10 the first day just for walking us to our room. We exchanged numbers, and that's the last I saw of him. I wanted roses and champagne for my anniversary, and he didn't answer until the next day. Trying to salvage the trip we set out to eat at all the restaurants.  The food lacked flavor.

The cleaning of the room was impeccable and with nice little touches as the flowers and the end of the day refresh to make the room ready for sleep. If you are part of the Serenity experience you’ll have your own personal butler. Gabriela was our butler and we had her in instant message and didn’t have to worry about anything, from scheduling restaurants and spa, to suggestions for the day, reminding before activities, really anything. The Ollio restaurant was  the best. There’s a dressing code and they take it seriously, so go prepared. The entertainment is very good."

Both of our outlets in our room, by the bed, stopped working and after talking to the front desk it never got resolved.   Food was really good and so were all the drinks. The Asian restaurant, Satsu, was by far the best.   As we were preparing to leave, the Amstar vehicle was 30 minutes late(forgot about us) so they sent us to the airport in a private vehicle.

It’s a very beautiful resort. The check in process was great. We arrived about 2 hours early and they held our bags for us while we explored and grabbed lunch. Once our room was ready we were escorted via golf cart which we were very grateful for because our room was pretty far. There is construction going at the resort due to the convention center they’re building but we were not near it so I didn’t affect us. There are some things that could use improvement though. The food is very basic and I did get food poisoning on the last day our our trip. Lighting in the room is very dim which will make it hard for those who do makeup.
