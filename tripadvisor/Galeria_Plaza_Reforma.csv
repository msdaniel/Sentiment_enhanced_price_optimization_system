Whenever I asked him many places inside and outside the City, he accurately recommended the ways and places to visit during working days and weekend. As the location is excellent, people came to this hotel for meetings. Also, GYM was convenient."

The room itself is basic comparable to a  Courtyard Marriott hotel. Our room is quiet with window view of the angel of independence statue. I slept like a baby here and i am a light sleeper! The bed and pillows are very comfortable . The staff is all great and courteous. The breakfast buffet is worth it. The restaurant is also very good! We watch the  Superbowl at the bar and had some great piña coladas. Very convenient location and walkable to a lot of stuff. I will use this hotel again if im back to CDMX . Highly recommend."

The hotel staff was amazingly helpful and kind.  The lobby was very nice but we did not eat at the hotel restaurants or visit the hotel bar.  The restaurants looked amazing but we were looking for some 'local' spots each day to eat.   For ""touring"" CDMX I thought the location was 'close enough"" to Polanco, but also to Zocalo as well as points North (like Teotihuacan) and South (like Condesa, Roma, San Angel).   The rooms were nice, clean, comfortable and spacious.  Nothing spectacular but I was not looking for spectacular."

They helped with scheduling my tours, assisted with directing me to reliable services I needed during my stay, and made excellent restaurant recommendations. I used the pool on multiple occasions to wind down while enjoying a tasty beverage. The hotel is located in a safe zone within walking distance to tourist attractions and great food."

Plenty of restaurants and bars around the area although the cuisine at the hotel is also great, the buffet breakfast is one of the best in Mexico and the dinner menu is for sure to settle any appetite. Rooms are great and very quiet. Service is outstanding, there is always a member of staff around to attend to any of your needs and super helpful.

Next, he was able to get a reservation at a very exclusive restaurant at the last minute. I’m not sure what strings he had to pull but he performed a miracle. I will never forget that.

They have their own money exchange onsite with good rates, a bar open late for an evening drink, a gift shop with some very unique and beautiful souvenirs, and rooftop to relax if needed.

Safety, comfort, luxury, views, and great food options. We truly enjoyed our first CDMX trip and it was mainly in part because of the service we received at the hotel. We will definitely stay at this hotel when we return to Mexico City. We used the taxi service from the hotel to get around. They have dedicated drivers that were attentive and offered great service. We highly recommend this hotel if it’s your first time visiting Mexico City."

Everything was top notch - but truly Alfredo (I think he siad his last name was Sanchez) made my stay memorable.  He quickly learned my name and when I  asked him about things to do in the city, he was kind and so knowledgeable about the city. I appreciated his smile and his hard working attitude.  He made me feel like I was a VIP. Thank YOU"

We ate two dinners at the hotel, which were perfectly prepared and delicious. The breakfasts were lovely. It was our first trip to Mexico City. I don’t think the location could have been better! It is a lovely, leafy green, pedestrian, friendly neighborhood, just off the Avenida Reforma. What impressed me most, was the concierge, Ronniel. As a former designer, and architecture aficionado, I had really hoped to see the Casa Luis Barragán. In leading up to the trip, I was unsuccessful in getting a reservation through the museum website.

The music from the clubs kept us up at night even with ear plugs. It goes on until like 4 or 5 am. Relentless thumping body vibrating bass. We had to request a room change. Luckily they were able to accommodate or I would have rated this hotel much lower. The bed was a bit hard and the water pressure is weak. The shower isn’t fully closed so water does tend to get everywhere. Not a big deal and I would have given them 5 stars if we didn’t have to go through the hassle of changing rooms. The location was great. It was our first time in Mexico City and it provided a nice central location to explore. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The breakfast buffet was fine but I wouldn’t"
