The resort is breathtakingly beautiful, and the atmosphere is so relaxing and peaceful! Our butlers, Gustavo and Roberto took such great care of us and drew up romantic bubble baths and had aromatherapy ready for us every night. Carlos and Omar supplied us with fresh cold water and plenty of towels on our beach cabana daily. The spa was so relaxing, especially our VIP romantic experience. Gerardo and Roger were our waiters on the beach for our romantic dinner and they had us laughing and smiling the whole time. And Thalia our concierge set up a whole itinerary and helped with every single want and need we had. The food here is absolutely amazing, the service is incredible, and we can’t wait to come back for"

This is one of my favorite resorts and it was great to share with the family just how pampering and stunning the resort is. The staff to guest ratio is part of the wonderful and attentive resort  experience that is signature to Le Blanc.   Roberto and Joel, the doormen, are gracious, offer a cool towel and handle luggage to all guests at arrival. The lobby is stunning in the simplicity and its signature fragrance of mint & cucumber. Room amenities are Bvlgari Blanc.  Guests receive a carnation and warm neck pillow and a refreshing coconut tropical drink at check in. The bracelet with the room key built in is very convenient. Our concierges Roger and Ingrid handle our dinner and spa bookings. Each floor also has day/evening"

We were new to eating Sushi and Lorenzo made amazing recommendations and brought us lots of samples to try. It was more than just a meal, he created an experience. Tomas at Bella provided exceptional service to us twice. We were even greeted with roses on the table for our final meal of the trip.

My husband and I have been to Moon Palace resorts 10-15 times, but this was our first visit to Le Blanc and we were beyond impressed.  Moon Palace has always been so incredible, but Le Blanc is on another level of pampering.  There wasn't a single bad experience we encountered.  From the lovely Nadia who greeted us, our amazing server at the pool, Jeanette (she is truly amazing!), our butlers Hugo and Ramiro who were always willing to help with whatever we needed, and Axel who did an absolute exceptional job cleaning our room each day.  There are so, so many other people who treated us so kindly all week that I can't list them all. The restaurants are so incredible, I just can't say enough.

Their attention and execution made the stay even more enjoyable.     There was a great vibe at the main pool with surprises and delights at any given time (fun games, churro cart, sangria cart, ice cream stand, hand-delivered treats, mimosa bar, occasional music).

We traveled with our member friends and had another wonderful trip.

We are four days into our ten day stay, and are very happy. Everyone here is pleasant, friendly and willing to go out of their way to make your experience fabulous!   Jesus at the lunar pool is friendly, & efficient.  He is more than willing to answer questions and help with anything he can! Carlos at Terraza is beyond!  He recognizes us and has things prepared just for us! Wow! Victor at the Buffet was wonderful. Emmanuel at the concierge helped us out with changing some reservations.  He worked his magic! The French is a must do- our main waiter Cesar was beyond. He knew the menu and explained everything to us perfectly. They work as a team there and we were very impressed. The head waiter, Carlos, seated us early to help us out!"

Every time we are at Le Blanc we experience a wonderful time and that is only achieved by how hard the staff of the hotel works to make your stay the best ever.   * I will say the restaurants are very good but I do wish that they would feature their Mexican restaurant  inside. It is very hard to enjoy a nice dinner when it’s so hot and humid outside. I would love to see the Mexican restaurant share space with their steakhouse, perhaps even alternating evenings. I wanted to enjoy it more, but it was very difficult due to the weather but their staff is amazing starting with Edgar, Yesenia, Rafael, chef Adrian are amazing and try very hard to give you a great experience."

I absolutely love the hydrotherapy run at the spa. It is unique and relaxing. Every one greets us by name and makes the experience very personal. The hostess Delilia greeted us each morning at the Blanc by name after only giving her my name once. Orlando the spa butler made each day at the spa impressive and relaxing for me, and my wife's attendant Anna was as equally impressive according to my wife. It is all the little things that make this place shine. Gustavo our room butler was amazing. He greeted us every time we walked by him. He made it a point to make us feel welcome and to assist us with any needs that may have arisen. The service anywhere on property is first class. The pools have enough staff so you are not"

I’ve been to a couple in Cancun. As this was by far the most calm and peaceful. There weren’t as many activities throughout the day or night, but that’s what we wanted for our honeymoon. We just wanted to spend time with each other. If you’re looking for a crazy, party resort…this is not your place. This is a beautiful, calming resort. The staff was what made our trip incredible. Jesus, Rafael, and Jose at the pool were so much fun everyday. Erik at breakfast and lunch knew our drink order everyday. Ricardo, victor, and Edgar at dinner treated us so well that we requested them multiple times to eat dinner with them. Everyone treated us like royalty. Even Ana at the spa was so sweet."

The exceptional experience offered by this establishment left us both spellbound and immensely satisfied. We were particularly impressed by the culinary delights served at all the restaurants, with Lumiere, the French eatery, and Terraza, specializing in Mexican cuisine, standing out significantly. Lumiere managed to captivate our taste buds with their exquisite chocolate soufflé, and the stellar service added a feather to their already illustrious cap. Terraza, on the other hand, amazed us with their chef's off-the-menu specials, providing a pleasant surprise to our gastronomical adventure.   The resort's butler service deserves special praise as well. Our heartfelt"

Laura is amazing!  Then you have people like Alexander at the third floor pool who goes above and beyond.

But you get what you pay for.   From the front desk where we checked in with Cynthia  to our butlers,  Saul and Jose everyone looks to make your trip a wonderful experience.

We also enjoyed all the delicious restaurants, amazing poolside cocktails served by the most hardworking staff, and all the fun entertainment and activities they hosted.
