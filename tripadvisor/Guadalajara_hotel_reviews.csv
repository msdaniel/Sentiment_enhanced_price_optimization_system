A great shopping center devoted to shoes. The only issue that we experience is the noise on weekends from the roof top bar across the avenue which can last until 3 AM. On the facility, they need to have better window locks since it is quite risk if you have children"

I persisted and finally got a map with printing so small and street names unreadable.  I stopped in the nearby Holiday Inn where I got a proper map.  Concierge could not name a single close place to go for lunch, just seemed flummoxed by the question.  They were very nice and really trying to be helpful.  But overall they could not help with basic questions.   My biggest issue here is the area.  After dark feels deserted, very creepy, apparently this is how it is downtown."

Of course, don’t expect too much at this price, too. The reason it gets one star is because of its way of handling business. It’s a common practice in the hotel industry that a second guest is not charged extra unless parties of two needs to be fit in a larger room. In fact, when I booked the room on Orbitz, this hotel charged a same price for one guest and two, and they are still doing it as of today. However, when I arrived at the hotel with my friend under a one-guest reservation of a king-bed room, the front desk demanded $150 more for the second guest.

And not a lot of hotels offer help in situations when they don’t have to help you. But this hotel does. Thanks to the concierge Mr. V. Navarra, we were able to fix some problems after our bag was stolen in the city center. The staff in this hotel has been exceptionally friendly and helpful. The mix of being professional, authentic and helpful was sublime! Definitely worth booking this hotel when you’re in Guadalajara."

The hotel restaurant has very good food, we ordered room service, many times, got their pizza, chicken cordon blue, omelettes and chicken Caesar salad all were superb, inexpensive and no room service charge.

The rooms and common areas are quite nice, comfortable and clean.  But the hallways are very narrow and the doors are not sound proofed.

I also can't recommend room service.  I understand that things get busy, but there is no way on earth that it should take an hour, two phone calls, a third call that rings 12 times and a trip to the front desk for a ham sandwich.

I think this location is perfect for tourists, since you have the centro historico nearby, but also you're not that far from other neighbourhoods.

The problem I personally found was the lack of sound proofing of the rooms, a lot of what your next door neighbor watch, does among other things can be easily hear from room to room specially at night, or when stroll down the hallway looking for your room.  Personally, I will consider this not the best for families but otherwise a good inexpensive and modern Hotel.  Lastly, parking small, good location with an OXXO and a Pharmacy within 100 ft away.  Hotel personnel are friendly but front desk at night is short handed, so if you patient and don’t mind your neighbor to make noise in the middle of the night, this maybe the best deal for you."

We booked a 3-night stay. While we normally select a hotel around the Histórico Central area, we decided to stay in a different location for a change of scenery. Hence the reason we selected to stay at the Hotel Velvet Plaza. BIG MISTAKE...  We arrived in the morning prior to the standard 3 p.m. check-in so it was not a surprise when we were advised that our room was not ready. A couple hours after we ate breakfast at a restaurant next door, we inquired again whether any rooms were available.   The front desk agent informed us that she could check us in early for a fee 500 pesos.

I asked for more pillows and waited over 3 hours only to be told they didn't order enough for entire hotel. There's also a limit of 4 towels per room?! Ummm why??

Our room was on the 7th floor on the south side of the hotel. There is a nightclub with intense drum and bass-type dance music absolutely blasting all night below somewhere. We were able to sleep through it the first night because we were so exhausted from our trip but the second night it was impossible to sleep through the bass and drums you could feel in your body in bed.   The hotel should absolutely not book anyone in on that side of the building on weekends. They need to get something done about that noise or soundproof the rooms.   Everything else was great about the hotel but I am not looking for a place to shower and leave my luggage. I also need to sleep.

The hotel is very comfortable, the room was the right size, and we had a room with a view of the city. The elevators broke down one time, but glad we were not in there when that happened. In my opinion, the restaurant was pricey so I decided to go to a small cafeteria around the corner. What cost MXN$255 at the hotel, I paid MXN$45 at the cafeteria, so their prices are insane.

About 15 feet at its widest spot, and 3 feet deep at most; it was dirty, cold, and had a nasty slime on the pools surface.   2. Next comes the staff. Yes, they spoke English, but they were rude, and mean.

Hotel needs a serious paint job on the outside.  The water in the showe was either really hot or really cold, you have to adjust it for several minutes to be tolerable. Once in the shower you had to grab on to something because it felt like a firetruck hose on you.  The breakfast they offer you is a joke, it's coffee and a small plate of food. That's it!!

Center of the city, Chapultepec is very near, cafe Providencia (which is half a block away) is the best breakfast spot in town.  The rooms of Laffayette are a little gloomy though, the internet connection is average and strongly depends on the location of your suite.  The windows in the suite open, which is a plus.  The elevator is good, but i personally prefer walking up the stairs, and sometimes they don't have lights and i am scared i will fall or something... But it cannot be held against the hotel, because guests are not normally expected to walk all the way up to 11-12 floor. The restaurant in the hotel isn't very inviting, so i have never been there.

Hint: Always ask for discounts/promotions when checking in. We took a look at the room prior to booking it. The room was great, comfortable with jacuzzi and view to the pool. Staff was wonderful!  One of the negative things was the sofa bed, my kids slept there and complained the mattress was too hard. Check to make sure who ever sleeps there is comfortable. The outdoor pool was nice and warm. They have movie nights, great for family:) parking available and walking distance from the mall. Oh and if you have kids, there is McDonals two blocks away."

Yes, it is true that this property is under renovation; it's true that somehow their just new rooms have a smell that is related to the paint and new furniture.   BUT..the hotel is Modern, centrally located in a good neighborhood, the employeeds are well trained, the price of the rooms is fare for their luxury.   AND..the management will walk the extra mile to make felt good.   As a personal experience I put a telephone call to te United States that was supposed to be the first 5 minutes free and the rest at a certain fee. The next day when I asked for my bill I was told the whole call was free as courtesy of the hotel. Time of the call was more than 50 minutes!"

We spoke to the manager about  the room being so small and the lack of a table, he said that the room is what one gets when one books online!  Wow!  the room was described as an executive room.

My luck was that I used a coded credit card that does not allow billing unless a code is sent through cellphone, so they could not charge my card.

They are most of the time short in staff, so it may take a while to get your car from the valet parking, check in or store your luggage. This compensates with free services like Wi-Fi and parking.

What a gem! The people are friendly and ready to help. The rooms are spotless and beautifully appointed. The Hotel cafe has excellent food. I ate an avocado, bacon omelette with tasty salsa and tortillas everyday for breakfast. The buffet is very popular. The Hotel is a tightly run ship. You can tell every employee knows their job. And the price of a room can't be beat. I suggest the sixth floor.  Venture through the safe, vibrant working-class neighborhoods and get a taste of real Mexico and rare tourists sightings. Two blocks away is Coltrane Cafe on a bohemian street with only foot traffic. Nurse a beer or cappuccino. While I was there stools were set up and a gentleman played Spanish guitar.
