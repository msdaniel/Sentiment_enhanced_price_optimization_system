Great location, right beside the zocalo. Hence the name. The lobby was very impressive. With a high ceiling cafe with skylught roof and wall garden. The staff were very accomodating and helpful. They tended to all our needs. The cafe at the ground floor is open 24 hours and serves great snacks and coffee. This really helped when we got hungry in the middle of the night. It was awesome that everything with the exception of alcoholic beverages were complimentary.   The room was not so spacious but was fine as we did not stay in the room most of the day. The room and bathroom was very clean. No complaints whatsoever with the room and staff.   The breakfast at the top floor was superb! I really enjoyed the food. The pastries were"

Unfortunately, their gym is very very poor and depressive and the only treadmill in there is not working.   Balcon del Zocalo is a must for breakfast with buffet and menu options all included in your rate, from eggs to chilaquiles or pancakes.  Erick Brandon Alonso is a rockstar with the service and he takes spectacular pictures that will look your Instagram fantastic."

Tons of things to do and great restaurants nearby. The hotel itself has small but comfortable rooms. Everything is super clean and in good repair, so it is very comfortable, secure, and convenient. The hotel has a good breakfast- though not amazing- on the beautiful rooftop deck, with outstanding views. It is the same place as the Balcon de Zocalo restaurant, open at night, but clearly the daytime cook is not as fancy. You get omelettes, other egg dishes, enchiladas, pancakes, etc to order, and they are fine, but not outstanding. There is also a buffet with premade dishes, fruit, etc. It includes coffee and juice and refills, so a very"

You are steps away from the cathedral, and an easy walk to the Palacia Dr Belles Artes (where we saw a fantastic performance of the Ballet Folklorico!).   While the breakfast views and free snacks at the well-stocked snack bar (open 24/7) are worthy enough of a great review, it’s the customer service that blew us away. At every point of our stay, hotel staff went above and beyond to ensure we had what we needed. One person in particular, Edith, at the front desk, was phenomenal.

The price is right for the cleanliness, location, security and design.  We actually booked a different hotel just to try something different and upon arrival learned they wouldn’t have electricity until night time, the security and service left a lot to be desired.  Thankfully, we were able to cancel and booked a Jr. suite that saved our trip.  Thanks to Fernando who made our checkin a breeze and went above and beyond to accommodate us.  We were greeted with top shelf tequila and had the best view of el Zocalo.

All of the taxi and Uber know this place. Uber is about $6.00. This is my third time here in the last 12 Months. Edith was efficient, courteous, and professional. She checked me in with a smile on her face. Felt very welcome. Requested a room with windows. This is very important. If you don’t make the request, you might get a room without windows. Looks like a jail cell. The rooms are well decorated with free bottle water. The free breakfast are provided by the well recognized restaurant on the sixth floor. Very delicious.

The location can not be beaten-right on the corner of the central square with superb views from the rooftop bar and restaurant. The room was clean and comfortable and the staff so helpful. What impressed me most was the thought that had gone into what their guest might want-there were fridges on every floor with bottled water (especially welcome as it is not wise to use tap water even for brushing teeth) and then there was the 24 hour café in the lobby. We weren't really listening when we checked in and thought we could get  complimentary tea, coffee and beer (even that was impressive!!), We used it twice for tasty snacks after two busy days of sightseeing and discovered when we came to settle our bill they were complimentary"

The location is stunning, the restaurant is superb, cleanliness is excellent, and the guest rooms reflect the classy style that is evident not only in the lobby but beyond.  These factors alone would merit a better than good review. But it is the staff that really lifted the experience to make it quite exceptional. All of them; from the front desk to the housekeeping personnel.

At arrival the street was blocked off by riot police evidently expecting some excitement  and when we  were due to leave some days later   the Zocalo was filled with hundreds of thousands of people from all over the country celebrating the 4th year of the current president's tenure.. It made for some nervous moments as there was no way a taxi was going to get anywhere near the place to take us to the airport... Anyway, besides this excitement  we very much enjoyed our stay.. Kicking out an extra $50 a night we upgraded to a suite when we arrived and it was luxurious indeed.. especially compared to the regular room we were given on our way out.. If money is not an issue go for the upgrade... You'll get a big"

Zocalo central is an outstanding hotel, where the customer is really made to feel like a king- I felt like a queen 😊 Nothing is too much trouble for all the staff, who are friendly, helpful to a fault, and professional.  I’ve been staying at Zocalo Central since 2016 and it will continue to be my home away from home in Mexico City."

LOVE. LOVE.   Stayed here for four nights in November 2022. The hotel is in the heart of CDMX and across the street from the Cathedral and National Palace. It is a couple blocks from the pedestrian shopping street and lots of good restaurants are within walking distance.   Hotel staff are awesome. I was greeted with a tequila shot upon arrival. Check in was smooth and the front desk staff are professional and friendly. Next to reception is a small cafe that offers FREE food (soups, salads, and sandwiches) and beverages (water, fruit, yogurt, teas, coffees, juices, and beer) for hotel guests 24/7. Yes. 24/7. Pro tip: guests cannot tip on the receipt, so bring cash if you wish to tip the staff. Each floor has a refrigerator stocked with cold water and a basket of apples for"

From amazing view,  the cool atmosphere and really friendly staff.  They know what they’re doing and what they’re talking about, and you can tell making the customers happy is their main priority. Food is high quality and tasty.  I would really like to thank Jose Rivera our waiter he was very helpful in accommodating our requests.   He provides excellent customer service and truly care about the customer satisfaction.   Paulina and Nadia Mendoza where amazing as well.  This restaurant has a great team that really values your business."

Simply amazing. Perfect. I hosted a welcome party for guest visiting Mexico City for the first time. Paty Valencia with the events team went above and beyond. Her and her team made sure every single detail was accounted for. She was very responsive and her communication throughout the entire process was incomparable. The hotel itself is located in the most important part of the country. The decor and ambiance  is very hip/trendy. Staff is very attentive and helpful. The food at the venue is amazing. Event coordination is world class and customer service is top notch. I could not recommend Paty and her team enough for your next event. I will be coming back next time I host a special event in Mexico City.   -Johnny"

Bar none. What made Zocalo the best? Put simply, the staff. Without exception every interaction I had with the staff at this hotel was great. From the lady who cleaned our room, to the hotel manager, the staff were without exception, pleasant, kind, patient, helpful, and completely professional, while making me feel like family.  Absolutely top marks go to Cinthya the concierge who went above and beyond in her duties to make our trip to her city one of the most memorable, and pleasant events in my life. Also, to be commended is Francisco the hotel manager, who always took time out of his incredibly busy day to ask us if we needed anything and to pleasantly chat"

As soon as we arrived, Raul grabbed our luggage and ushered us inside to check in. We were too early to check in, but Raul and the front desk associate showed us to the 24/7 cafe for refreshments (food and drink included with the stay). The hotel itself is gorgeous and at the time we went, decorated in Dia de Los Muertos decorations. We opted for the Zocalo view, which for the first floor on the corner means a view of the metropolitan cathedral and a slightly obstructed view of the National palace and zocalo, but still a good view. The room is so nice with wood flooring, a cute sitting area, his/her sinks, a big shower (no tub), coffee maker, and an abundance of toiletries. They also have a fantastic"
