I traveled with family & young children (19 in our group) a few things you should be aware of.  First the negatives: -No AC in 90% of the hotel :( I wish we knew that before booking because I would have thought twice before going. Our room had AC & maybe 2 restaurants I remember. My brother's room was hot, the AC was terrible. The buffet had AC only in the first few tables (which were never available) if you ever been to Cancun you know the heat + humidity is very uncomfortable.  -Restaurants were long waits so that was frustrating with young children. They do have outdoor pool service for food & room service so that was a great alternative. -The Reserve/Nikte upgrade was a total waste of money. Our Concierge didn't do"

The rooms are nice and spacious but not equal. We had to change rooms do to the AC not working well and the replacement room did not have the same amenities as our original room. My favorite servers were Atilano and Joni. But especially Atilano. He made my breakfast very comfortable and enjoyable.  Other Servers weren't that helpful.  I also enjoyed my concierge Liz, She did a great job making sure we had everything we needed and gave accommodations when we were inconvenienced.  She was awesome.  There was another young lady who's name I forget she wished nightly at the coffee bar and bakery during our stay.  She remembered my favorite drunk and snack and made sure we had it nightly."

Some notes: when reading reviews, consider the number of suggestions a reviewer has posted and ask yourself if you want to trust your precious vacation days to someone with 1 review. Also, be open-minded and fair when looking at 1 or 2-star reviews as there are some people who write negative reviews of a hotel because it rained while they were there or had unrealistic expectations (such as asking for a free penthouse suite upgrade when they booked a garden view room). Lastly, if you are going to take one or two specific reviews into consideration, take a look at the writer’s profiles and see if they have been to that location before or if it was their first time. Someone who’s been to a location numerous times has multiple experiences to compare"

She was so helpful and communicating was very easy since we are in the United States. She absolutely went above and beyond. Very organized from getting the photographer, private dinner at the beach, flowers and a special breakfast the morning after. I greatly appreciate all the hard work in planning this special day for my son and future daughter in law. I highly recommend Guendoline and Paradisus Cancun for the special experience they offer."

The guy at the desk gives us completely wrong information about a lot of things and all the restaurants he says are open are closed. After 4 hours we come back and the guy calmly says, no sorry the room still isn’t ready, come back in another 30 minutes. We can’t even do anything, we don’t even have our luggage because they took them, and we’re bored out of our minds. Horrible, horrible service, I would never recommend this hotel."

Views are amazing from all areas of hotel.We went with our 3 teenagers. Everything is so close. Beach, pools are so close to all rooms which made me feel at ease when my boys wanted to roam free. The excursions they recommend are outstanding. I can’t say enough about the entire staff at resort. They do go above and beyond to help with any needs or questions. They all have such positive attitudes. One staff member that absolutely stood out was Gaudencio. He was our server at beach. So anytime you’re on beach make sure to look for him. He took care of us all 6 days and was on top of everything. Making sure my children and husband had everything they needed. He constantly checked in on us and knew all our orders ahead of time.

The kids enjoyed the beach and pool for hours and we enjoyed being together and laying around being together - the point of the trip.  I hadn't intended to sign my kids up for the kids club, but the calendar for the Kidsdom was enticing enough that the kids wanted to go on their own.  The staff there was great - Tessa, Rubí, Ivana, and Bruno - took good care of the kids with constant programming, not just to sit in a room and play with random toys.  As my oldest says: ""It is an appropriate and fun for kids of all ages.""  The kids really enjoyed the crafts at the Kidsdom and by Handmade on the Terrace every day at 4."

Shoutout to servers Gabriela & Jamil for being fantastic, and Alex, the activities guy, was a lot of fun too.   Cons: The rooms were quite warm. Our AC unit said it was 18.5C (65F) and there's no way that was the actual temperature. We had to sleep on top of the covers at night.  The lobby area in the main building was also very warm. This is where several restaurants are and we were sweating quite a bit in this area.   A swimup bar in The Reserve pool would have been a nice addition."

Just walk into the lobby and  it smells like heaven. The resort was super clean and well maintained the entire week by workers. The staff is amazing all around the property. Pools are amazing. We loved the cabanas and pool side attendants on the reserved side. It’s definitely worth upgrading to The Reserve. Building 5 is lovely.   My biggest complaints as it has been for 6 trips are the restaurants and nightly entertainment. The buffet was wonderful for breakfast and lunch. It was ok for dinner but one section is closed because it’s the waiters station for the Italian restaurant. The other restaurants are just bad in my opinion. Sal’s steakhouse is highly overrated. I will admit that entertainment"

It was vast but was negotiable with a lot of walking. We had a party of 15 Family members and generally we were happy with most of the amenities. With a party as large as ours, there were a few room glitches (bathroom drainage + A/C problems). As a result, switching rooms sometimes took a bit to do covering a day or so. The MOST important thing was that the staff of the Paradisus Cancun was top notch and was very helpful in all facets of service. Joni Atilano and Viajes Jiménez was especially helpful when it came to the restaurant Malva. They placed our Family basically in the same table area every time we were there no matter how many of us attended breakfast, lunch and dinner.

The pool area is pretty extensive, well setup. Some of the personnel enjoy their jobs, but certainly not all. These are in my mind the only positives of this hotel. The quality of the  all- inclusive food is dubious. While the omelet station and ready made food is OK, the rest is not. While there are restaurants where you can sit and order food, good luck trying to get a table, specially at the on-prem steak house. This place is a joke.
