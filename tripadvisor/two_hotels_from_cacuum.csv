Basically feels like a hospital. Also the fraudulently play Hyatt content on the TV’s to make people think they are part of Hyatt when in fact they are not.   Avoid at all costs and stick to larger chains if possible. At least within Cancun"

Our room had city/seaview. There was a glitch in the frame of the balcony door. We heard loud music until 4 and 5 am every night, and were not able to sleep. We made the staff aware of the situation, but they did nothing to help us. We felt that we were met with a cold shoulder. The service of the staff didn’t reflect the prize we had to pay to stay there. It is very unfortunate, we have had a long flight to get to Cancun from Norway.  There was long waiting lines to get a table for breakfast, and they even ran out of food at 10 am. And there was supposed to be served until 12.  When we were eating breakfast, the staff could come several times and ask us about our room number,"

We paid around $350 for a ocean view, asked for a king, got two doubles, room was old, loud due to the cement hallway, poor air conditioning, the toilet broke, the coffee machine was per junk. The pillows felt like soft rocks. The desk staff was unfriendly and tried to charge us extra. The margarita was the worst I’ve had."

We are definitely ok with the bare minimum but this was worse than we expected.  We liked the price and decided it couldn't be that bad, but it is bad...  The room is good! nothing wrong with the room and the resort, but it's the food and drinks. The food is so so bland, we couldn't eat here. We struggled to find food outside of the resort as well but the food here was very bad. Kinda like hospital food.  The drinks are made with watered-down bottles of alcohol.  I think I (a small woman) had maybe 10-15 drinks one day by the beach in the hopes to feel a buzz but nothing. They make you pay extra for unopened alcohol like bottled beer.  It's a"

I don’t understand how this hotel is only a 3 star hotel because it feels like it is a 5 star hotel.   Cons: a few of the staff in the reception gave us wrong information. For instance one person wrote wrong room number on the key card so the key obviously didn’t work so I had to go back to the reception and someone else told me the right room number."

We had booked a room with a king-size bed but were told that ""beds are not guaranteed"" and had to sleep in that room for the first night, despite informing the front desk that we were on our honeymoon and had booked a different room.  Every time we went to the front desk, we had to wait at least 10 minutes (and sometimes 15 or 20) just to see someone at the front desk.  Someone from housekeeping took my hair towel (which looked very different from any of the hotel's towels) and we had to spend about two hours playing phone tag with the receptionist at the front desk to eventually get housekeeping to return the towel.

We have pictures from 2017  of steaks and other meals from the Italian restaurant that are no longer on the menu.  The fish tacos were still good.  The Mediterranean restaurant had a few nice choices.  We had to ask for water bottles to replaced every day.  That is something that should have been automatically done on a daily basis.

The food was ok. Not much of a variety for lunch or breakfast. Our butler “mayordomo” Daniel, made our experience very enjoyable and stress free. He made a reservation for us at the restaurant “She” and he checked in on us during our stay. He was polite, attentive and helpful from arrival to departure!  We highly recommend him!  It seemed like capacity was around 30% and this led to evening events that were lackluster. The resort is 1.5 hours from the airport and this requires an additional expense. Perhaps there can be shared transportation in the future when there is higher occupancy.  The best part was their staff!!  Very welcoming."

I would say be very open minded and non judgmental when booking this hotel because the things you will see is EXTRAORDINARY compared to other hotels. I didn't drink, even though it was all inclusive, but I probably would have enjoyed myself more with some drinks in my system. I think this hotel is more for the older generation seeking to live young, wild, and free. It was definitely not for me, but I can check the experience off my list. There were several reviews about the food, but we highly enjoyed the food. I was only disappointed in my fact I there were no real authentic Mexican food.

In addition, the premium liquor that we have always gotten as members was not available forcing us to buy the liquor that we drink offsite and provide to bartenders to make us drinks.
